I think that efficiency is not reflected by overtime, but by our own work level. If one thing needs to be done for an extended period of time, the cost will increase greatly, and the gain will not be worth the loss. So, I think that how to complete our job faster and better is what we should consider.  
我认为效率不是靠加班时间体现的，而是我们本身的工作水平。如果一件事情还需要延长时间来做，其成本大大增加，反而得不偿失。所以我认为，如何更快、更好地完成本职工作，才是我们该好好考虑的。

## 30. 时事热点类问题——新冠

Western countries are very passive in dealing with the new coronavirus, which is not only irresponsible to their own people but also irresponsible to the people of the world. Our country faces severe risk of imported cases.  
西方国家在疫情爆发初期并没有足够的重视。他们几乎没有采取防控措施。西方国家应对新冠病毒非常消极，既是对本国民众不负责任，也是对世界人民不负责任。我国面临严峻的输入型病例风险。

### （2）你怎样看待这次疫情的影响?

What do you think of this epidemics?

Pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus is a serious global public health event. Our government has strict quarantine measures to keep people isolated at home. Those who go out need to wear masks. Many doctors and nurses fight the epidemics on the front line. People donate supplies to the hospital. The whole society has made a great contribution to controlling the spread of the new coronavirus.  
新冠肺炎是严峻的公共卫生事件。我国采取了严格的隔离措施，出行的人需要佩戴口罩。许多医护人员在一线抗击疫情。人们向医院捐赠物资。全社会都为控制疫情做了很大贡献。

## 31. 介绍一下你参加的大创项目

Introduce the innovation training program for college students you participated in.

Aiming at the problem of forecasting daily tourist flow in mountainous scenic spots with multiple features, we propose the SVR-LSTM combined model based on residual analysis approach: First, we train SVR with historical passenger flow and dimensionality-reduced Baidu Index as features. Then, we use weather conditions and holidays as features to train the LSTM model to predict the residuals generated by the SVR model. Finally, the passenger flow predicted by SVR is combined with the residual error predicted by LSTM to obtain the final predicted tourist flow.  
针对含有多个特征的山岳型景区日客流量预测问题，我们提出了一种基于残差分析方法的 SVR-LSTM 组合模型：首先，我们将历史客流与降维后的百度搜索指数作为特征训练 SVR 模型。然后，我们将天气状况和节假日作为特征训练 LSTM 模型，对 SVR 模型产生的残差进行预测。

## 32. 介绍项目中用到的一些方法 \ 简述一下 XX 的过程 \ 最喜欢的机器学习算法

Introduce some approaches used in the project.

### （1）主成分分析 PCA (Principal component analysis)

PCA is the most commonly used approach of linear dimensionality reduction. Its goal is to map high-dimensional data to a low-dimensional space through a certain linear projection and expect to maximize the variance of the sample points after projection. In this way, fewer data dimensions are used while retaining the characteristics of more original data points.  
主成分分析 (PCA) 是最常用的线性降维方法。它的目标是通过某种线性投影，将高维的数据映射到低维的空间中表示，并期望投影后样本点的方差最大化，以此使用较少的数据维度，同时保留住较多的原数据点的特性。

### （2）支持向量回归 SVR (Support Vector Regression)

The full name of SVR is Support Vector Regression, which is an application of SVM to regression problems. SVR establishes a “spacer band” on both sides of the linear function. For all samples that fall into the interval band, no loss is counted. Only samples outside the interval band are included in the loss function. (Then optimize the model by minimizing the interval width (ε) and the total loss.)  
SVR 全称是 Support Vector Regression，是 SVM 对回归问题的一种运用。SVR 在线性函数两侧建立了一个 “间隔带”。对于所有落入到间隔带内的样本，都不计损失。只有处于间隔带之外的样本才计入损失函数。（之后通过最小化间隔带宽度(ε) 和总损失来优化模型。）

### （3）长短期记忆神经网络 LSTM (Long short-term memory)

LSTM is a special kind of RNN, mainly to solve the problem of gradient disappearance and gradient explosion in the training process of long sequences. LSTM controls the cell state through gates. There are three different gates to regulate the information flow in the LSTM unit: input gate, output gate, and forget gate. There are three main stages inside LSTM: forget stage, select memory stage and output stage.  
LSTM 是一种特殊的 RNN，主要是为了解决长序列训练过程中的梯度消失和梯度爆炸问题。LSTM 通过门来控制细胞状态。有三个不同的门来调节 LSTM 单元中的信息流：输入门、输出门和遗忘门。在 LSTM 内部主要有三个阶段：忘记阶段、选择记忆阶段和输出阶段。

## 34. 这个项目研究的不足之处有哪些？/ 实验设计的漏洞 / 有待深入的研究

What are the shortcomings of this project research?

(1) In terms of feature fusion, we perform PCA dimensionality reduction on Baidu Index. However, this does not completely eliminate the redundant information, so it is necessary to explore more effective and more suitable dimensionality reduction methods for Baidu Index.  
(2) In terms of model construction, it is difficult for us to determine the characteristics of residuals. It is also necessary to further explore the root causes of passenger flow residuals, extract effective features, and further improve the prediction accuracy of residuals.  
(3) In terms of model testing, due to the difficulty of data acquisition, the model only predicts the passenger flow of Jiuzhaigou, lacking the support of data from other scenic spots, and cannot prove its effectiveness for other scenic spots.  
（1）在特征融合方面，我们对百度指数进行了 PCA 降维。但是，这并不能完全消除冗余信息，因此需要探究更为有效且更适用于百度指数的降维方法。  
（2）在模型构建方面，我们难以确定残差的特征。还应进一步探究造成客流残差的根本原因，提取出有效的特征，从而进一步提高对残差的预测精度。  
（3）在模型检验方面，由于数据获取比较困难，该模型仅仅对九寨沟的客流进行了预测，缺乏其他景区数据的支撑，无法证明它对其他景区的有效性。

## 35. 研究生阶段你要做什么（master 硕士）/ 你感兴趣的研究方向是什么？

## 41. 介绍某一种算法（快排，堆排等），介绍进程和线程等

### （1）介绍一下快速排序算法

Can you introduce the quick sort algorithm?

According to the sentinel element, two pointers are used to point to the beginning and the end of the array to be sorted. The first pointer is moved from front to back to find the element larger than the sentinel element, and the tail pointer is moved from back to front to find the element smaller than the sentinel element. Exchange these two elements until the two pointers meet. After this sorting, the elements larger than the sentinel are on the right and the smaller elements are on the left. After multiple passes of sorting, the entire array becomes ordered.  
根据哨兵元素，用两个指针指向待排序数组的首尾。首指针从前往后移动找到比哨兵元素大的元素，尾指针从后往前移动找到比哨兵元素小的元素，交换这两个元素，直到两个指针相遇。经过这趟排序后，比哨兵元素大的元素在右边，小的元素在左边。经过多趟排序后，整个数组变得有序。

### （2）介绍一下堆排序

Can you introduce the heapsort algorithm?

Take ascending sort as an example. For a heap, the top element of the heap is the largest, so after the heap is built, the top element of the heap is exchanged with the last element, and a downward adjustment is made to the top element of the heap. Repeat this until there is only one element in the heap.  
以递增排序为例。对一个堆来说，堆顶元素是最大的，因此在建堆完毕后，将堆顶元素与堆的最后一个元素交换，进行一次针对堆顶元素的向下调整。如此重复，直到堆中只有一个元素为止。  
（Heapsort refers to a sorting algorithm designed by the data structure of the heap. The heap is a complete binary tree structure, and at the same time satisfies the nature of the heap: that is, the key value or index of the child node is always less than (or greater than) its parent node.  
堆排序是指根据堆的数据结构设计的一种排序算法。堆是一个完全二叉树的结构，并同时满足堆的性质：即子结点的键值或索引总是小于（或者大于）它的父节点。）

### （3）什么是进程和线程？

What is the process and thread?

An executing instance of a program is called a process. Each process provides the resources needed to execute a program. A process has a virtual address space, executable code, open handles to system objects, a security context, a unique process identifier, environment variables, a priority class, minimum and maximum working set sizes, and at least one thread of execution. Each process is started with a single thread, often called the primary thread, but can create additional threads from any of its threads.  
每个程序执行的实例被称为进程。每个进程提供此程序的所需要的资源。一个进程有一个虚拟地址空间，执行代码，操作系统的系统接口，一个安全的上线文，一个唯一的进程标识符 (PID)，环境变量，一个优先级类，设置最大和最小的工作空间大小，和至少一个线程在运行。每个进程都以单个线程启动，通常称为主线程，但是能创建多个子线程。

A thread is an execution context, which is all the information a CPU needs to execute a stream of instructions. A CPU is giving you the illusion that it’s doing multiple computations at the same time. It does that by spending a bit of time on each computation. It can do that because it has an execution context for each computation.  
On a more technical level, an execution context (therefore a thread) consists of the values of the CPU’s registers.  
Threads are different from processes. A thread is a context of execution, while a process is a bunch of resources associated with a computation. A process can have one or many threads.  
Clarification: the resources associated with a process include memory pages (all the threads in a process have the same view of the memory), file descriptors (e.g., open sockets), and security credentials (e.g., the ID of the user who started the process).  
线程是一个执行上下文，它是 CPU 执行指令流所需的所有信息。CPU 会给你一种错觉，即它正在同时进行多项计算。它通过在每次计算上花费一些时间来做到这一点。它可以做到这一点，因为它对每个计算都有一个执行上下文。  
在技术层面上，执行上下文（因此是线程）由 CPU 寄存器的值组成。  
线程不同于进程。 线程是执行的上下文，而进程是与计算相关的一堆资源。 一个进程可以有一个或多个线程。  
澄清：与进程关联的资源包括内存页（进程中的所有线程都具有相同的内存视图）、文件描述符（例如，打开的套接字）和安全凭证（例如，启动进程的用户的 ID）。

### （4）你能说一下进程和线程的区别与联系吗？

Can you talk about the difference and connection between process and thread?

a) Threads share the address space of the process that created it; processes have their own address space.  
b) Threads have direct access to the data segment of its process; processes have their own copy of the data segment of the parent process.  
c) Threads can directly communicate with other threads of its process; processes must use interprocess communication to communicate with sibling processes.  
d) New threads are easily created; new processes require duplication(克隆、复制) of the parent process.  
e) Threads can exercise considerable control over threads of the same process; processes can only exercise control over child processes.  
f) Changes to the main thread (cancellation(取消), priority change(优先级的改变), etc.) may affect the behavior of the other threads of the process; changes to the parent process does not affect child processes.  
a) 线程是共享内存空间的；进程的内存是独立的。  
b) 线程可以直接访问进程中的数据部分；进程有他们独立拷贝自己父进程的数据部分，每个进程是独立的。  
c) 同一进程的线程之间直接交流 (直接交流涉及到数据共享，信息传递)；两个进程想通信，必须通过一个中间代理来实现。  
d) 创建一个新的线程很容易；创建新的进程需要对其父进程进行一次克隆。  
e) 一个线程可以控制和操作同一进程里的其他线程；但是进程只能操作子进程。  
f) 对主线程的修改，可能会影响到进程中其他线程的修改；对于一个父进程的修改不会影响其他子进程 (只要不删除父进程即可)。
