# 3.2 介绍你的论文/项目
当前的许多序列推荐模型由于训练策略和数据集划分等方面的差异，导致缺乏统一公平的比较方法。同时，现有的序列模型评估大多停留在数据指标层面，对于性能差异的具体原因以及模型推荐的具体内容缺乏详细分析。例如，模型A比模型B好，究竟是因为模型A推荐了更多高流行度的物品（这些物品可能大多数人都喜欢，命中率较高），还是因为模型A更好地捕捉到了用户的偏好。此外，选择数据集时往往比较随意，没有考虑到数据集本身特征对模型效果的影响。

为了探究数据集特征可能对模型效果的影响，我在选择数据集时，特地选取了不同特征的数据集。同时，通过对不同模型之间的推荐内容进行两两对比，并对比结果以及效果指标，尝试解释这些模型之间结构差异与推荐结果之间的关系。

My research work is inspired by that many current sequential recommendation models lack a unified and fair comparison due to differences in training strategies and dataset splits. And most existing evaluations of sequential models just stay at the data metrics level and don't provide detailed analysis of the specific reasons for performance differences and the exact content of the recommendation list.  This may lead to some confusing situations. For example if model A has a higher score compared with model B, is it because model A better captures user preferences or just because it recommends more popular items (which most people might like, leading to higher hit rates)? Additionally, the choice of datasets is often random, without considering how the dataset characteristics ‘s  affect to the model performance.

To solve this problems,  we deliberately selected datasets with different features. On top of that, We retrained and evaluated some representative sequential recommendation models while trying to maintain consistent training strategies and  we compared the recommendation list from different models pair by pair to explain the relationship between the structure differences of these models and their recommendation outcomes.

# 3.4 介绍你的本科学校?

In short, Shandong University  provides a great environment for both academic and personal growth and inspire students to reach their full potential and make a difference in the whole world.


# 3.5 介绍你的家乡 Can you tell me a little bit about your hometown?

Of course! I come from Lu'an, a beautiful small city in Anhui Province. It's known for its rich history and cultural heritage , often called the "cradle of the Red Army" due to its important role in revolutionary activities. Lu'an's history dates back to the Qin and Han dynasties and was a key part of the ancient "Huainan Road." 

Nestled in the heart of the Dabie Mountains, Lu'an has wonderful natural scenery. The Dabie Mountain National Forest Park and Tiantangzhai Scenic Area are popular tourist spots, offering great opportunities for hiking and nature watching. 

Besides its natural landscapes , Lu'an is also famous for its local teas. Lu'an Guapian tea is one of China's top ten famous teas, known for its unique aroma and taste. The city is also known for other local teas, such as Huoshan Dendrobium and Shucheng Xiaolan flower tea, which are iconic to Lu'an.

In summary, Lu'an is a place with a profound historical background and beautiful natural landscapes. It offers a blend of cultural heritage and scenic beauty, making it a wonderful place to explore!


# 你最喜欢的事情是什么？
One of my favorite things to do is running. It gives me a sense of freedom and energy with every step I take. Not only does it keep me physically fit, but it also helps me clear my mind and relieve stress. While running, I can enjoy the scenery around me, breath the clear air  and even find inspiration. Whether it's running in the crisp morning  or enjoying a sunset jog in the evening, it always brings me immense joy and satisfaction.
# 你最喜欢的课程是什么？
One of my favorite courses is machine learning. What fascinating me most about it is its practicality and creativity. Studying machine learning allows me to grasp a powerful tool for solving complex real-world problems. I enjoy delving into data analysis and model building to understand and predict real world phenomena, which keeps me challenged and engaged. Moreover, the rapid development in the field of machine learning means there's always something new to learn and explore, which keeps me motivated to continue learning new knowledge.
# 介绍你感兴趣的方向
One of my favorite directions is recommendation systems. Recommendation systems are very important in modern society. They make our online experiences better by recommending products, movies, songs, and more that match our tastes. Whether you're shopping online, looking through social media, or just watching short videos, these systems help you find what you love. They analyze what you like and don't like, and use that info to give you personalized recommendations. This will keeps you engaged and coming back more. With the development of the technology, these recommentation systems are getting even better at understanding us, making them an indispensible part of our digital lives.
And from my perspective, recommendation systems are one of the key reasons for the success of some famous applications like taobao, pdd and douyin. 
# 简要介绍一下 NeuralCF 算法
Neural Collaborative Filtering is a recommendation algorithm that employs deep neural networks to model complex user-item interactions. It embeds users and items into low-dimensional vectors and processes them through an MLP to do non-linear transformations. Unlike traditional collaborative filtering methods, such as matrix factorization, NeuralCF can better capture the interactions between users and items.

# 用英文介绍一下SGD以及与传统梯度下降的区别
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) differs from traditional gradient descent in that it computes the gradient using only one (or a few) randomly selected training example(s) per iteration, making it faster and more memory-efficient for large datasets. In contrast, traditional gradient descent computes the gradient using the entire dataset for each iteration, leading to more stable and smooth convergence but requiring more time and memory。
# 介绍一下 Adam 处理器  Adaptive Moment Estimation
Adam, is short for Adaptive Moment Estimation. And is a popular optimizer in deep learning. It calculates gradients and use the gradients to update moving averages of the gradient and its square. It then corrects bias of this two values and updates the parameters using these corrected values.  It's basic idea is that using the method of Moment to decide the update direction of the parameters and use the square of the averages gradient to avoid the over-update of the parameters. 
# 你未来的规划是什么？
In the future, I want to be a university teacher after I have finished study. Because I likes the active atmosphere at University, and the most important reason is that university teachers can have a lot of time to concentrate on the direction of their interest. 
# 研究生阶段有什么计划？
In the period of postgraduate, I want to continuely improve my english, math and programming. I will not only focus on improving my english reading and writing, but  I alse will spend more time to practice english listening and speak. If I have the chance to exchange abroad or study aboard, I absolutly want to seize this chance. On top of that I want to enhance my ability to do research. I will join the lab as early as possible and try to generate high-level papers.
# 介绍一下 WSDM 这个会议。
The WSDM (Web Search and Data Mining) conference is a highly respected international forum focused on research in web search, data mining, and related areas. The conference covers a wide range of topics, including search algorithms, information retrieval, data mining techniques, recommendation systems and user behavior analysis. It was ranked as ccfb-Class conference by the  China Computer Federation.
## 简要介绍一下transformer 的结构
Transformer is a neural network architecture.  It has two main parts: the encoder and the decoder.
The encoder processes the input data. It has multiple layers, each layer contains a multi-head attention block to focus on different parts of the input and a feed-forward neural network to further process the information.
The decoder is similar to the encoder, it also has multiple layers but each layer it has an extra mult-head attention block with mask mechanism compare with the encoder.  This helps the decoder produce the final output only using the past information.
## 简要介绍一下S3rec
S3Rec (Self-Supervised Semantic Recommender) is a recommendation model that leverages self-supervised learning to improve recommendation accuracy. It combines both supervised and self-supervised learning methods to capture more semantic information from user-item interactions. The model includes several innovative components:
1. **Self-Supervised Learning**: S3Rec uses self-supervised learning techniques to generate useful representations of items and users by predicting various attributes or relationships within the data.
2. **Semantic Information**: By incorporating semantic information, S3Rec can better understand the context and meaning behind user interactions, leading to more accurate recommendations.
3. **Multi-Task Learning**: The model employs multi-task learning to jointly optimize the recommendation task and several auxiliary tasks, enhancing its overall performance.
4. **Contrastive Learning**: It uses contrastive learning to distinguish between similar and dissimilar items, which helps in learning more discriminative features.
S3Rec's architecture and training methodology enable it to outperform traditional recommendation systems, especially in scenarios where labeled data is scarce or noisy.
## 简要介绍你的推荐系统项目
The recommendation system project consists of three parts the frontend,  the backend and recommendation part,  The frontend is the part users see and interact with. It's built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The backend use the java's jetty framework to communicate with the frontend and the recommendation part. The recommendton part use spark to process data and use tensflow to build the recommendation model. 
# 线性代数知识点
## 介绍一下矩阵的秩及其应用
从极大线性无关组的角度定义：矩阵的所有行向量中极大线性无关组的元素个数。
它代表线性独立的行或列的最大数量。
矩阵的秩也用于评估降维效果。当选择的主成分数 k 接近原始矩阵的秩时，降维后的数据几乎保留了所有信息；而当 k 小于矩阵的秩时，降维后的数据可能会丢失部分信息，但可以有效地减少维度。
线性方程组的解:
矩阵的秩用于确定线性方程组是否有解及其解的数量。当矩阵的秩等于增广矩阵的秩时，方程组有解。如果矩阵的秩小于未知数的数量，则方程组有无穷多解。

## 特征值和特征向量
如果一个向量投影到一个方阵定义的空间中只发生伸缩变化，而不发生旋转变化，那么该向量就是这个方阵的一个特征向量，伸缩的比例就是特征值。
特征向量的代数含义是：将矩阵乘法转换为数乘操作；特征向量的几何含义是：特征向量通过方阵 A AA 变换只进行伸缩，而保持特征向量的方向不变。特征值表示的是这个特征到底有多重要，类似于权重，而特征向量在几何上就是一个点，从原点到该点的方向表示向量的方向。
作用：奇异值分解、主成分分析
