### 12 Habits That Changed My Life
Last year I had developed a bad habit of **snacking**。

I had lost all self-control in the face of a free `donut` or plate of cookies. And I made justifications for my actions
donut 甜甜圈

Excuses like: 'well, I did go to the `gym` today.' 'Overall I eat pretty healthy'

I knew something had to change when even though I exercise often, I noticed I was developing early `onset` bad-gut. 
肠道开始变坏

And apart from simply putting a little bit of weight on your gut。
There's a lot more serious problems that can come with eating too much sugar. It can damage your `metabolism`
metabolism 新陈代谢

cause type 2 diabetes, increase the likelihood that you'll get liver or kidney damage, causes `inflammation` of the skin
皮肤炎症 关节疼痛 蛀牙，甚至勃起困难
`joint pain`, tooth decay and even problems maintaining an erection。

I know the first thing that I want to do right now is `go through` my entire 搜索

apartment, and find all of the things that have added sugar, and get them out of my apartment.

But without reading the labels and `digging into` weekly snacks and meals, I wouldn't know for sure
  
There were of course some `no-brainers`. Ice cream is loaded, 不用思考

Chocolate snacks are packed, My once a month energy drink.

But I was also surprised to find a lot of sugar in my` protein bars`,

My breakfast `cereal` is basically a dessert. Even the bread I was buying had 5 grams / slice

`carving: an extremely strong desire for something`
The `carvings` were the worst for the first couple days, but even a week in I was struggling late at night

Instinctively I went to my snack `cabinet` and I'll show you guys what I found

So I asked my friend Becca Shern to help clear some things up for me. She's a registered `dietician` and founder of Minimal Wellness 

`dietician` 营养师

That's like `table sugar`, or honey, or high `fructose` corn `syrup`  "My king, this corn syrup was just delivered"
`table sugar`：蔗糖 `fructose` : 果糖  `syrup`:  糖浆

You're not aiming for 25 grams of sugar every day it's like

over the course of a week, over the `course` of a month. Like some days are really low,

some days are quite high. `course : 过程`

I knew it, but then I was still surprised by certain things
Like my `granola bar` was like 30 grams of sugar and I'm like, that's why I taste so good!
`granola bar` 燕麦棒

Let me show you guys what we're working with here. We've got your rice your chicken and your daily recommended

bacon. I should be eating more `veggies`. I just realize that right now.

Small bad habits, like snacking on junk food can build up and `compound` to something much worse.
`compound`  使加重；使恶化  复合物；混合物

In the past, I had relied on `smoothies` to get most of my vitamins, 冰沙

While they do include vitamins, nutrients and `fiber`s that are good for you,

I wanted to force myself to eat more greens.
`fiber` 纤维素，食物纤维

I'd have fish with brown rice and sauteed `kale`

 `kale` 羽衣甘蓝   `sauteed` 炒
We have `curry cod` with some brown rice and sauteed
curry 咖喱 cod 鳕鱼

And the kale, I actually sauteed it with some `chicken broth` with which I'm also gonna be drinking here
鸡汤


I primarily eat for `sustenance`, while she cooks and eats for the love of the food.

`sustenance` : food that people or animals need in order to live

I found `workaround`s and substitutes for all meals that included sugar

`workaround`:a method, especially a temporary one, that you use to achieve something when the normal method is not successful

Instead of `fig` jam sauce I used mustard
fig : 无花果 mustard: 芥末


I used olive oil and a healthy squeeze of lemon, `topped with some salt and pepper.`
top 在这里是指在上面撒一点

`Holy crap`, you're crashing, and you have no energy。

Holy crap 十分惊讶

especially if you're not paying attention, is to `gravitate` towards something that will give you quick energy, which

sugar.
gravitate: 吸引


I also reduced my `carbs` partly because of the reduction in added sugar
carbs : 碳水

It's hard to `pinpoint` the exact percentage of benefit

pinpoint:  to discover or explain exactly the real facts about something or the cause of a problem 

but I want to bring it back in `moderation`

`if you do something in moderation, such as drinking alcohol or eating certain foods, you do not do it too much `

I ate like a `doughnut` and a half ,and I still feel horrible. 
甜甜圈


# I learned a system for remembering everything

but remembering everything might `be a bit of a stretch` for the average person. 有点牵强

It's easier for us to remember events that provide a deviation from our typical sensory experience.

so I've got my tools here, highlighter, pen, my `post-it` bookmarks here, and a stack of note cards
`post-it` 便利贴

The reason why this kind of system is so effective at helping us retain more of what we read `comes down to` how our brains process information.  原因是， 归结为


So becoming a better learner is all about putting in the work 投入工作

he thinks that there's an advantage to going analog.

they make it `insanely` easy for me to bring my ideas to life,

With a few clicks, you can add a hero image to your homepage, you can start your very own newsletter,
and `outline` your core business offerings.
`outline` to describe something in a general way, giving the main points but not the details 


with detailed `analytics`, scheduled posts, and so much more.
`analytics`  analyse

it's become clear that this is a very slow and `methodical` process. 有条不紊地


If you're anything like me, this can make you feel a bit `antsy`


`antsy` nervous and unable to keep still because you are waiting for something to happen 

becoming superhuman and `devouring` books in a day.


and to try to find ways to reuse and `repurpose` what I'm learning

`repurpose` used in a new way that is different from its original use, without having to be changed very much

You should see how fast I can `scarf down` food at this fancy restaurant

`scarf down` 狼吞虎咽地吃

I don't know how many boxes of note cards I can have at my place and still keep my `sanity`.
`sanity` the condition of being mentally healthy

My system is an `amalgamation` combination of Rob Greene's
amalgamation 合并

You're better off starting imperfectly than being `paralyzed` by the hope
or the` delusion` of perfection.

` delusion` a false belief about yourself or the situation you are in 

`Stay tuned` in a couple weeks for new video
`Stay tuned`  继续收看；

# 12 changes that change my life
This fly was definitely testing me on this `meditation`. n. 冥想

Tried intermittent fasting.
尝试了间歇性禁食

it can cause a `ripple effect` throughout other areas of your life. 连锁反应

That was the `spark` that led to so many other positive changes in my life. 导火线，诱因

[16:20.15]You here to give me my sponge bath?
[16:26.15]- - PJ? - Hey, mom.
[16:28.85]What are you doing here?
[16:30.75]I'll tell you what I'm not doing here--
[16:32.75]Giving sponge baths to big hairy guys.
[16:37.35]So, mom, what's-- what's the happs?
[16:39.85]What's--
[16:43.55]Hey, honey!
[16:46.45]- - Bob! - Nice work, son.
[16:49.65]Okay, what's going on here?
[16:51.65]Dad fell down the stairs and broke his butt.
[16:54.35]- You weren't holding the baby, were you? - Um, yes--
[16:58.05]Then no, then yes again.
[17:00.75]Bob, you promised me you weren't gonna drop this one!
[17:06.05]Honey, look, it was just a little accident.
[17:07.95]Oh, and by the way, for the record-- an amazing catch!
[17:11.55]I knew this was a huge mistake.
[17:13.95]I never should've gone back to work.
[17:15.55]Sweetheart, this is all gonna be okay.
[17:17.85]No. no, it's not.
[17:19.35]It's too hard. I can't do this.
[17:21.95]I mean, what made me think I could go back to work full time
[17:24.45]and take care of four kids?
[17:26.55]I'm a terrible mother.
[17:29.05]No no, you're not.
[17:30.75]Look, if anything, I'm a horrible father.
[17:33.35]I know!
[17:35.45]Would you guys chill?
[17:37.15]You're great parents.
[17:39.35]Teddy, gabe and me turned out pretty good.
[17:41.25]Yeah, come on.
[17:42.75]We've got to be doing something right.
[17:44.65]I mean, hey, look at this-- our son's a doctor.
[17:49.35]I'm serious. With both of us working,
[17:52.55]Poor little Charlie doesn't stand a chance.
[17:54.65]Come on, no one's going solo on this.
[17:57.25]All us kids are gonna help out.
[17:59.65]And if charlie gets a little messed up along the way,
[18:03.15]We can all share the blame.
[18:05.95]Dr Chandrasooleewan to the operating room.
[18:08.45]It never ends!
[18:15.95]Gabe Gabe!
[18:20.55]Sorry about that, Mrs Dabney, but you
[18:22.35]probably shouldn't let him in.
[18:23.95]I didn't let him in. He crawled through the cat door.
[18:28.75]Gabe, is there something you want to say to Mrs Dabney?
[18:31.65]Yeah.
[18:33.15]What are you fixing tomorrow night?
[18:36.75]The cat door.
[18:38.45]Gonna make sure it's locked.
[18:40.45]Okay. I think we're done here.
[18:42.35]- Good night. - It is now.
[18:45.65]All right, let's go.
[18:51.75]- What are you doing? - Oh, so now you're suddenly
[18:54.85]- interested in me? - gabe, you're my little brother.
[18:57.95]I've never been interested in you.
[19:00.85]I'm kidding.
[19:06.55]What's going on?
[19:08.75]Ever since the baby arrived,
[19:10.75]Everyone's been ignoring me.
[19:12.45]I feel like I'm invisible.
[19:17.95]I'm just the loser middle kid. . .
[19:20.15]Like you.
[19:22.25]Just because I'm a middle kid doesn't make me a loser.
[19:24.85]Then what does make you a loser?
[19:28.85]I am not a loser. Okay?
[19:30.55]And I was a baby once.
[19:33.15]And then you came along.
[19:34.85]And I was not happy about it.
[19:37.55]But then you peed on PJ and I thought,
[19:39.35]" Hey, give the kid a shot."
[19:42.55]Look, someday you're gonna feel the same way
[19:44.05]a bout Charlie that I feel about you.
[19:45.85]Well, how do you feel about me?
[19:49.45]Let's put it this way--
[19:51.15]The hottest guy in school is at our house right now,
[19:54.05]And I'm here with you.
[19:58.95]Look how cute she is.
[20:07.55]I am warming up to her already!
[20:14.35]Okay, Charlie's asleep, Gabe's playing a video game
[20:17.55]And we are finally alone.
[20:24.75]Hey, everybody!
[20:28.35]I have a bruised coccyx.
[20:33.55]Oh, come on!
[20:36.05]That's a funny word.
[20:38.65]Coccyx!
[20:41.35]The doctor gave him pain medication.
[20:45.55]Was that me? Sorry.
[20:47.85]I'm a little numb down there.
[20:50.35]Uh, actually, that's my ride.
[20:52.95]Of course it is.
[20:56.85]It's good to meet you, son.
[21:00.75]Oh, good night, sweetheart.
[21:07.15]Good night, sir.
[21:18.85]- Good night. - Good night.
[21:25.35]Coccyx!
[21:33.55]So that's how dad got my first kiss
[21:36.65]And how you flew for the first time.
[21:38.65]But the good news is--
[21:40.75]Nah, there is no good news.
[21:45.15]I take that back! It's a text from spencer!
[21:48.05]He wants to hang out with me tomorrow night
[21:49.85]At his house!
[21:51.85]Oh! I've gotta go wash your puke out of my jacket.
[21:55.75]Oh, and, uh, one more thing--
[21:58.55]When you're my age and you meet a cute boy,
[22:01.25]Do not, under any circumstances,
[22:03.85]ever ever bring him home.
[22:07.85]Cause if you do, well--
[22:09.55]Charlie Good luck, Charlie.
[22:15.85]Oh, that's wonderful.
[22:19.15]Thank you so much for doing this.
[22:21.45]Hey, if I can't be there for my patients,
[22:24.65]What kind of pretend doctor am I?
[22:32.95]So, uh, do you ever think about shaving--
[22:35.95]Like, everywhere?
	[22:40.15]I did-- last week.

[01:41.45]Well, look at that.
[01:43.35]Ivy Oh, that's funny, Ivy.
[01:46.05]Then your response is " lol."
[01:48.35]" laugh out loud."
[01:51.55]No-- no, mom. you don't do it, you type it.

[03:31.15]Don't ignore me!
[03:33.45]When I tell you to do something, I expect you to do it!
[03:35.75]Get off my back, woman!
[03:37.45]You want me off your back? I can arrange that.
[03:42.45]Charlie, those are our neighbors, the Dabneys.
[03:44.85]They've been married a long time.
[03:49.65]Hey, PJ, I just kicked the football into the Dabneys' backyard.
[03:53.05]Will you go get it?
[03:53.95]No way! they're going at it again.
[03:56.75]- Well, what about the football? - Who cares?
[03:59.45]It's gone. Kiss it goodbye.
[04:01.45]Well, I'm glad to hear you say that
[04:03.75]Because it was your football.
[04:21.85]Ha! I warned you!
[04:23.55]That's what you get for being a bad husband!
[04:26.65]And now you're dead!
[04:34.25]Is somebody out here?
[04:36.15]Who's out here?
[05:03.45]- Where's the football? - Forget the football!
[05:06.65]Mrs Dabney just murdered Mr Dabney!
[05:09.95]What? !
[05:11.95]I heard her talking to his corpse.
[05:13.95]It was chilling.
[05:16.05]Just so I'm clear, you didn't get the football?
[05:20.45]- I'm serious, Gabe. - Come on.
[05:23.35]Mrs Dabney may be a mean, vicious, cruel,
[05:26.15]horrible, nasty old witch,
[05:29.35]But she'd never do something like that.
[05:31.65]- You don't believe me? - No.
[05:33.25]Fine. fine, I'll prove it.
[05:35.25]Gabe Come here, Gabe.
[05:37.75]Hello?
[05:40.25]Is Mr Dabney home?
[05:44.35]He. . . can't come to the phone.
[05:46.85]Interesting.
[05:50.15]Who is this?
[05:52.15]Uh-- I'm some sort of salesman.
[05:58.35]Gabe, is that you?
[06:00.35]Why would you assume my name is gabe?
[06:04.15]Because I have caller ID.
[06:08.65]Oh. then yeah, it's Gabe.
[06:11.65]Hey!
[06:13.85]Whoo! She's cool under pressure, I'll give her that.
[06:16.85]- - PJ, she's not a murderer. - I heard what I heard, gabe.
[06:20.05]Why don't you believe me?
[06:21.65]Because you're you and you get things wrong.
[06:26.55]What are you saying, that I'm dumb?
[06:30.35]Well, no.
[06:32.15]You're just not very. . .
[06:36.05]- thinky. - thinky?
[06:39.65]Gabe, why would you say something like that?
[06:41.95]'cause mom said I can't call you dumb.
[06:46.05]It is so pathetic.
[06:47.95]My mom's in the kitchen texting away.
[06:49.95]Gosh, I'd hate to be on the other end of that conversation.
[06:51.95]Who are you texting?
[06:54.85]- Your mom. - I am so sorry.
[06:58.05]Look, I promise I'll get her out of your hair.
[06:59.45]No, it's okay. Your mom's cool.
[07:01.45]My mom is what?
[07:04.15]And she's really funny.
[07:05.75]My mom is what?
[07:08.25]Wait, that's her again.
[07:10.45]What are you talking about with my mom?
[07:12.75]- Nothing. - Nothing? !
[07:14.45]That's what we say to her!
[07:16.15]Hold on, I have to " lol" her.
[07:21.65]Okay, well " lol" has officially lost all meaning.
[07:26.05]I'm sorry. is this a problem for you?
[07:29.35]No, I just think it's a little bit inappropriate.
[07:32.05]Inappropriate? Now you sound like my mother.
[07:36.15]Well, how would you know what your mother sounds like?
[07:38.15]You've been spending so much time with mine!
[07:40.95]What are you getting so whacked about?
[07:42.95]You didn't want to text her.
[07:44.95]Well yeah, that's because she's my mom, not my friend.
[07:47.75]Wouldn't you be weirded out if I was texting your mom?
[07:49.75]Yes. Because she doesn't have a cell phone.
[07:53.45]Look, T, if you're not cool with this,
[07:56.05]I'll just stop.
[07:58.05]No no, I don't care. I mean, it's a free country.
[08:00.05]Go crazy-- text my mom,
[08:01.65]IM my dad, video-chat my aunt Helen.
[08:03.65]Ooh! your aunt Helen?
[08:05.75]Your mom says she is da bomb diggitty!
[08:09.45]My mom really said " da bomb diggitty" ?
[08:11.85]Well, I may have added that part.
[08:21.15]PJ, you've got to stop watching these mysteries.
[08:23.65]Not until i figure out how to catch Mrs Dabney.
[08:26.55]These old movies are gonna help me do that.
[08:30.05]That's like saying cartoons will teach you how to run through walls.
[08:32.75]Learned that the hard way.
[08:35.65]Mom! Can you get that? !
[08:39.65]Sure, I'll get the door. I am a lot closer to it.
[08:45.85]Hello, Mrs. dabney.
[08:47.85]- Hello. - Come on in.
[08:50.45]Heads up! killer in the house.
[08:54.25]What have they done this time?
[08:56.15]For once, nothing-- that I know of.
[08:58.85]It's nice to see you too.
[09:03.35]I'd like to speak with your husband, please.
[09:05.45]I'll let him know you're here.
[09:10.75]I'm a texter now.
[09:14.55]I'm texting.
[09:18.45]Really speeds things up.
[09:22.05]Somebody lose a ball today?
[09:24.55]Possibly. Did you lose anything today, Mrs Dabney?
[09:30.75]Honey, what does this mean " somebody's at the doof."
[09:37.15]OMG!
[09:41.65]I meant " door" !
[09:44.85](Talk to you later) TTYL.
[09:48.75]What can I do for you, Mrs Dabney?
[09:51.05]- You're an exterminator, right? - pest control specialist.
[09:54.95]Maybe you can help me with a problem I'm having.
[09:58.45]How do I get the smell of death out of my house?
[10:04.95]Will you turn that TV down?
[10:07.55]So you think something died in your house?
[10:09.15]Oh, I know something is dead
[10:10.85]Well, first thing you're gonna have to do
[10:13.15]is locate and dispose of the carcass.
[10:15.05]I suppose you could get Mr Dabney to do that.
[10:16.95]Oh, Mr Dabney won't be doing anything around the house for a while--
[10:21.45]A long while. he's. . . gone.
[10:27.85]You know what, would you just turn it off?
[10:31.25]What's wrong with your boys today?
[10:33.45]I just got here.
[10:35.75]Um, all right, old trick of the trade
[10:38.05]Get yourself some maple syrup, put it on the stove,
[10:39.65]Let it simmer-- that should get rid of the smell.
[10:42.75]Thank you. That's very useful information.
[10:46.65]Bye, boys.
[10:54.45]" ITBOOTP" " ITBOOTP"
[10:56.65]What does that stand for?
[10:59.35]In the bathroom out of toilet paper!
[11:04.45](Too Much Information) TMI!
[11:07.45]I can't believe it, but you were right!
[11:09.95]Mrs Dabney did it.
[11:11.65]Wow! this is what it feels like to be right, huh?
[11:15.95]I like it!
[11:17.95]Too bad somebody had to die, but--
[11:19.75]- What are we gonna do now? - I have to tell mom and dad!
[11:21.85]They're never gonna believe you.
[11:23.65]I didn't believe you and I'm 10.
[11:26.45]Well, then we need proof.
[11:28.35]And I have to warn you, Gabe, until we get that proof,
[11:30.55]Our lives may be in danger.
[11:35.65]I thought we turned that off.
[11:47.65]What'd you get for number nine?
[11:49.65]Switzerland.
[11:52.15]Well, that's odd since we're doing math.
[11:58.85]- Hi. - Hi.
[12:00.75]Mom, what are you doing here?
[12:02.85]You weren't supposed to pick me up at five.
[12:04.75]Teddy left a message and said to come by early
[12:06.75]Something about " chilling" ?
[12:10.15]Yeah, that's right.
[12:11.95]Thought your mom and I could chill for a little while.
[12:13.85]Really? This is what you're doing?
[12:16.15]Yeah well, this is what we're doing,
[12:17.75]So if you will excuse us,
[12:19.85]- We'd like a little privacy please. - Sure. fine.
[12:22.55]I'll be in the kitchen with your mom.
[12:36.25]Come on over.
[12:38.25]Sit down next to me, girlfriend.
[12:42.05]What's this all about? Is ivy in trouble?
[12:43.95]Oh, no.
[12:45.65]Is she back on the chocolate?
[12:49.45]No no no, Ivy's fine.
[12:51.15]I just wanted to spend some time with one of the cool moms.
[12:56.05]- You. - Oh.
[12:58.95]Okay.
[13:06.05]I love your outfit. Where'd you get it?
[13:07.85]My closet.
[13:14.25]You are so funny. I bet you get that a lot, right?
[13:16.75]- No. - no?
[13:19.65]Are we done chilling?
[13:22.75]Yes. yes, we are. Because it is time to par-tay.
[13:25.25]Let's get jam started.
[13:29.55]Yeah! come on, Miss W! Let your freak flag fly!
[13:33.05]Yeah!
[13:35.15]That's kind of loud. Could you lower that, please?
[13:38.45]Yeah.
[13:41.25]A little bit more.
[13:44.75]A little bit more.
[13:46.65]Perfect.
[13:49.25]Uh, hey, want to do something fun?
[13:51.25]I like making these video diaries for my baby sister.
[13:53.55]So how about we say hi?
[13:55.85]Hi, Charlie. it's teddy here
[13:57.85]With my new friend Mrs wentz.
[14:00.55]Hello.
[14:03.25]Let's see how we look.
[14:05.35]Ooh, I'd date us. Wouldn't you?
[14:07.75]I'm married.
[14:10.55]Okay, that's enough of that.
[14:13.15]Now, you know what? We've been doing a lot of my fun stuff.
[14:15.15]Tell me-- tell me about you. what do you like to do for fun?
[14:17.35]- I like to knit. - Ooh!
[14:20.55]That is so cool because. . . because. . . anything else?
[14:26.45]- I like to read. - Oh, yeah? Me too.
[14:28.65]What kind of stuff do you like to read?
[14:29.75]Kniiting magazines
[14:33.15]That's awesome. I mean, we have so much in common.
[14:35.45]You know, once I start reading knitting magazines,
[14:39.15]Which you're pulling out of your bag.
[14:49.55]Okay, she's gone.
[14:51.15]Here's how this is gonna go down.
[14:52.95]I'm gonna jump over the fence, you hand Charlie to me.
[14:55.55]- And then-- - Or I could just walk through the gate
[14:58.15]Like this.
[15:00.25]You did know there was a gate, right?
[15:02.95]Yes. would I be riding on top of it if I didn't?
[15:10.45]Now what?
[15:11.65]Now it's time to be in operation " catch a killer" . . .
[15:15.75]While babysitting.
[15:19.75]So, what are we looking for?
[15:21.75]Evidence, clues, a weapon.
[15:24.65]Mr Dabney's rotting corpse would be nice.
[15:27.95]Oh my gosh, that's horrible!
[15:29.65]- What? what do you see? - That paint color--
[15:32.85]It's so wrong for that room!
[15:36.85]- I watch a lot of design shows. - Focus!
[15:42.25]- Look. Something's moving. - Where?
[15:45.05]By the couch, right-- right there.
[15:46.95]- It's a baby! - It's Charlie!
[15:49.65]No, it's not. charlie's right over--
[15:52.35]inside the murder house!
[15:59.65]Okay, try to stay with me now
[16:01.85]Because we're going to get a little wild.
[16:04.25]Instead of knit one, purl two,
[16:07.65]We kick it up to knit one, purl three!
[16:10.95]Is that even legal?
[16:13.75]I don't know,
[16:15.55]But I just like living dangerously!
[16:18.15]Okay, I'm gonna go get something to drink.
[16:21.35]- Do you want anything? - Oh, not now.
[16:22.95]I'm in the zone!
[16:28.25]What you doing in here?
[16:30.05]Giving up.
[16:32.65]Did she suck the life out of you?
[16:36.55]Yeah, pretty much.
[16:38.35]Now you see why I'm always at your house.
[16:41.15]Yeah, I'm so sorry.
[16:42.85]I was being selfish with my mom.
[16:44.55]And even though I think it's a little bit weird,
[16:46.55]You can text her as much as you want.
[16:48.55]I think I got a better idea.
[16:51.75]And then, get this,
[16:53.45]If you type in a semicolon parentheses,
[16:55.75]- You get a-- - Winky face!
[16:59.85]I have got to get a cell phone.
[17:03.75]I like it. You put our moms together
[17:05.95]And they leave us alone. You are brilliant.
[17:08.15]See, this is why we're BFFs.
[17:10.15]I'm brilliant and you recognize it.
[17:13.15]Now if I type " ROTF."
[17:15.65]Do I actually have to roll on the floor?
[17:18.85]I thought the same thing at first,
[17:21.85]But no.
[17:24.75]This'll get her out.
[17:25.55]Charlie loves things that rattle.
[17:28.25]Okay, girl. Charlie, come on.
[17:30.65]Get the keys. Get the keys!
[17:32.25]Aw, man! I dropped the keys.
[17:34.55]Fantastic!
[17:36.75]Now we can't get into our house either.
[17:41.15]- I don't see charlie. Where'd she go? - Oh, there she is.
[17:49.45]Wait, what is she putting on her head,
[17:52.05]A dishtowel?
[17:54.05]Mrs Dabney's underpants!
[17:56.75]Oh!
[17:58.65]- Man! - Oh-ho!
[18:00.75]Come on, we gotta get her out of there.
[18:02.95]Yeah, come on.
[18:04.15]What are you doing in my yard?
[18:07.25]We're here to help you with your groceries.
[18:10.15]You want to be helpful?
[18:11.65]I like to try new things.
[18:15.15]Here, let me give you a hand with that.
[18:16.85]I can handle the groceries.
[18:18.75]But as long as you're here,
[18:20.85]I could use your help with something inside.
[18:23.05]Inside? Perfect.
[18:25.65]Let me just put my groceries down.
[18:28.65]- Take your time. - Yeah. Yeah.
[18:30.85]- - Where's Charlie? - uh--
[18:32.65]- Look behind the curtains! - Okay.
[18:36.05]- Nothing! - There she is!
[18:38.15]Oh, I've got you.
[18:41.25]Yeah.
[18:44.55]I don't want it!
[18:46.85]Stop it!
[18:49.25]Where did that baby come from?
[18:51.35]Charlie? I've been holding her the whole time.
[18:53.05]- You have? - That's sad, Mrs Dabney.
[18:55.75]They say the eyes are the first things to go.
[18:58.25]We gotta go.
[18:59.75]Not so fast. Put the baby down.
[19:01.55]I need you to carry something out for me.
[19:07.25]I want you to take this trunk out to my car.
[19:09.25]It's too heavy for me.
[19:10.85]Why? What's in it?
[19:12.45]Something I should've gotten rid of a long time ago.
[19:16.75]- Where are you taking it? - To the dump.
[19:18.35]That's where you take trash, isn't it?
[19:20.15]Trash? !
[19:21.85]Mr Dabney wasn't trash, he was a person!
[19:24.35]What are you talking about?
[19:26.15]You know exactly what I am talking about.
[19:28.05]You bumped off your husband and stuffed him into that trunk.
[19:30.55]- Is that what you think? ! - That's what we know!
[19:35.35]What is she-- oh, watch it!
[19:37.65]She's kill-crazy!
[19:39.75]You want to see what's in here?
[19:41.95]Take a look.
[19:48.45]Whoa! It's Mr Dabney!
[19:50.85]And he's already decomposed!
[19:53.25]That's not Mr Dabney.
[19:54.95]That's a skeleton he used in his classroom.
[19:57.05]He used to be a science teacher.
[20:00.15]But I heard you screaming at him.
[20:02.85]You called him a bad husband and then you said,
[20:05.15]" and now you're dead! "
[20:07.25]Oh! you must have heard me talking back to someone on my soaps.
[20:11.65]Soaps?
[20:13.05]Soap operas. . . on TV. . .
[20:15.85]Like the one they should name after you two--
[20:17.85]" the young and the clueless."
[20:21.15]Well, if Mr Dabney isn't dead, then where is he?
[20:23.45]At his mother's probably wishing he was dead.
[20:28.15]Well, then how do you explain the smell of death you asked my dad about?
[20:32.05]Dead possum in my dryer vent.
[20:34.05]Well, then how do you explain--
[20:36.95]That's pretty much it, I guess.
[20:40.35]Just one more question--
[20:42.45]Do you have any cookies?
[20:45.95]Get out.
[20:51.75]What are my underpants doing in the fireplace?
[20:54.15]Gotta go!
[21:03.15]Dat-da-da-da! Here she comes!
[21:04.85]Coolest mom in the world! Yay.
[21:07.95]Okay, what's all this?
[21:09.55]Oh, just showing Charlie how much I love you.
[21:11.45]Oh, I love you too, sweetie.
[21:13.15]Charlie And I love you too, Charlie.
[21:15.35]Oh, so mom, I've been thinking--
[21:17.65]Maybe you and I should start texting.
[21:19.65]I mean, you are a pretty cool mom, right?
[21:21.35]Oh, sorry, honey. Those days are over.
[21:24.95]Text thumbs.
[21:28.25]Text thumbs? That's our mom--
[21:30.65]From cool to embarrassing just like that.
[21:33.75]Charlie All right. good luck, Charlie.
[21:43.05]Hey, guys. Better make your friend a sandwich.
[21:46.15]He's looking a little thin.
[21:48.95]Where'd you guys get that thing?
[21:50.85]Mrs Dabney was throwing it out.
[21:52.65]Yeah, it belonged to Mr Dabney. He was a science teacher.
[21:55.35]Mr dabney wasn't a science teacher. He was a music teacher.
[21:58.55]What? !
[22:00.35]- That means-- - This is--
[22:09.55]Mr Dabney wasn't a music teacher.
[22:11.55]You're thinking of-- of Mr Dixon across the street.
[22:15.55]Oh, that's right. Mr Dabney was a science teacher.
[22:20.85]The boys seem a little jumpy to you?
[22:23.55]Ah, I just got here.

## 1.4
[00:08.15]Hi, Charlie. Teddy here.
[00:10.05]And Ivy.

[00:19.35]This is your biggest milestone
[00:21.35]since your first solid poop.
[00:24.75]Okay, relax. I didn't get it on video.
[00:27.05]Okay, you're my best friend again.
[00:30.25]Anyways, I wanted to capture your first steps on tape
[00:33.15]but every time I put the camera on you,
[00:35.45]all I see is this.
[00:39.25]Wait.
[00:41.25]Wait.
[00:43.15]Wait.
[00:45.15]And nothing.
[00:46.85]Same thing happened with the poop.
[01:11.05]Colonel C WaitinZ
[00:50.55]Today's all burnt toast
[00:52.15]Running late, and dad says
[00:53.75]Has anybody seen my left shoe
[00:56.25]I close my eyes, take a bite
[00:58.45]Grab a ride, laugh out loud

[01:22.75]Sure life is up and down
[01:25.15]But trust me, it comes back all around
[01:28.55]You're gonna love who you turn out to be
[01:33.65]Hang in there, Baby
[01:36.45]Good Luck Charlie S01E04 Double Whammy
[01:45.05]Girls, girls, come here. Check it out.
[01:47.65]It's an old video of me.
[01:51.25]Lots of videotaping in this family.
[01:53.45]You guys sure do like yourselves.
[01:55.45]It's from my old glory days back at south high.
[01:58.45]No way, Mrs. D. You went to our school?
[02:00.65]No, you're going to my school.
[02:05.25]Whoa whoa, there I am--
[02:06.85]The school `mascot`. 吉祥物
[02:09.35]You were that big sheep thing?
[02:11.05]Not a sheep. A ram.
[02:13.55]Rammy the Wammy.
[02:15.25]Here it is--
[02:17.15]My famous wammy wiggle.
[02:23.15]Listen to the crowd. They love me.
[02:26.35]Well, sure.
[02:27.95]Everybody loves a dancing sheep.
[02:30.25]Again,
[02:32.15]It's a ram. It has horns.
[02:34.65]It sure looks like a lot of fun, Mom.
[02:37.95]You really think so?
[02:40.05]Yeah yeah.
[02:42.15]Do you think I'd say something like that
[02:44.25]Just to humor you?
[02:47.45]I'm so happy to hear that
[02:49.35]Because they're holding mascot `tryout`s this week.
体育队、活动等成员的〕挑选，选拔 
[02:51.65]But, mom, you've already been wammy.
[02:53.55]Why would you try out again?
[02:55.05]I'm talking about you.
[02:57.05]Please tell me " You" Is Ivy.
[02:59.25]Teddy Think about it, Teddy.
[03:01.05]You would be the first ever second-generation wammy.
[03:04.35]I've been dreaming about this since you were born.
[03:07.05]According to the internet, sheep can have horns.
[03:10.95]Look, I don't want to put any pressure on you.
[03:14.65]It's your decision. You do not have to do this for me.
[03:17.25]- I don't? - No.
[03:19.25]You'll do it for us.
[03:30.55]- Hey. - What are you doing?
[03:33.85]Watching all my old wammy videos with Teddy.
[03:37.05]Teddy?
[03:38.75]You're missing all the good parts.
[03:41.05]What am I saying? They're all good parts.
[03:44.05]Except for this one.
[03:46.15]Bob Remember this, Bob?
[03:47.85]Oh, how can I forget?
[03:49.75]The night the north high barbarian took you down.
[03:55.95]Oh!
[03:57.55]I hated that guy.
[03:59.45]Even for a barbarian, he was a jerk.
[04:02.85]You remember the time those goons from north high
[04:05.45]grabbed you, took you on a little joyride?
[04:07.45]Every wammy's worst nightmare.
[04:10.15]You know what? I can't even watch it.
[04:12.25]It's too painful even now.
[04:14.05]Oh, wait, this is a good part.
[04:15.95]Come here, kids. You're gonna love this.
[04:18.65]Recognize that guy?
[04:20.65]Is that PJ?
[04:22.95]Nope, that's me.
[04:24.55]You mean that thin guy with a full head of hair is you?
[04:29.15]Yep.
[04:30.35]So that means
[04:32.25]I'm gonna look like you when I get old.
[04:34.25]Oh, I stopped looking like that when I was 25.
[04:36.65]But that's only eight years from now.
[04:38.55]Enjoy it while you got it.
[04:42.75]If I were you, I'd marry young.
[04:47.95]What are you doing in here?
[04:49.85]Not being out there. What tape is she up to?
[04:53.15]Volume three, " Wammy behind the mask."
[04:57.75]Dad, she wants me to try out.
[05:00.65]Oh, boy. I knew this day was coming.
[05:03.15]But I don't want to be a mascot.
[05:05.05]I'll be the biggest dork in school. You gotta help me out here.
[05:07.85]- What do you want me to do? - Can't you talk to her?
[05:10.45]Yeah, okay.
[05:12.65]I'll do that, honey, right after I mention
[05:14.65]that her favorite pants make her look fat.
[05:16.65]- Who looks fat? - My mother.
[05:26.35]Hey, we almost ended at the same time.
[05:29.35]Only because I dropped one of my sticks.
[05:31.85]Did you see Charlie?
[05:34.55]She was totally rocking out.
[05:36.45]- Is she amazing or what? - She's okay.
[05:39.15]Okay? What is that supposed to mean?
[05:41.45]You guys are always going on and on
[05:43.45]about what a super baby charlie is.
[05:45.55]Man, I got a nephew mason. Now that's a baby.
[05:48.75]What's so great about Mason?
[05:50.25]Well, for one thing he's a stud at peek-a-boo.
[05:54.15]Come on, Charlie can play peek-a-boo with her eyes closed.
[05:56.75]That's how you play peek-a-boo.
[05:59.45]What else you got?
[06:01.65]Well, Mason's an incredibly fast crawler.
[06:04.45]Not as fast as Charlie. She's like a cat.
[06:06.55]Mason sleeps at night with a rabbit--
[06:08.55]Not a stuffed one, one that he caught.
[06:10.85]So you think mason's faster.
[06:13.65]I think charlie's faster.
[06:15.25]There's only one way to settle this.
[06:17.35]We challenge you to a baby race.
[06:19.45]Oh, it is on.
[06:22.65]And you're gonna be sorry
[06:24.55]Because mason rhymes with racin'.
[06:28.45]We'll take our chances.
[06:30.25]In the meantime, you might want to take a good look at this,
[06:33.75]Because that's all you and mason are gonna be seeing.
[06:42.45]I can't believe you're trying out for wammy.
[06:45.65]The whole idea behind this friendship
[06:47.95]was for you to make me more popular,
[06:50.05]Not less popular.
[06:52.75]Okay, relax. I said I had to try out.
[06:55.35]I didn't say I had to do well.
[07:00.65]All right, people. Time for wammy tryouts.
[07:03.45]- First up, Teddy Duncan. - I'm Teddy.
[07:06.35]Daughter of Amy Duncan,
[07:08.15]The second finest wammy this school has ever seen.
[07:10.75]- Who was the first? - You're looking at her.
[07:15.35]Let's do this thing!
[07:18.65]All right, duncan, let me set the scene for you.
[07:20.85]The team is down by eight.
[07:22.45]You need to get that crowd jazzed up.
[07:25.35]Now give me what you got!
[07:29.75]Come on, crowd, jazz up.
[07:33.45]I am not feeling that.
[07:36.15]Moving on. How's your dancing?
[07:38.55]You tell me.
[07:58.35]What was that?
[07:59.85]That was interpretive dancing.
[08:01.95]That piece was called " Spring Day."
[08:03.95]I can also show you " Global Warming"
[08:06.25]Or " Dogs Wow! "
[08:08.45]Dancing-- question mark.
[08:10.15]Question mark?

[08:11.45]That `stuck`, exclamation point! 
exclamation point 感叹号

`stuck` 困住了


[08:15.45]All right, duncan, one more thing.
[08:17.45]Take that flag there and fire up that crowd.
[08:28.55]There's something wrong with that flag.
[08:30.65]Duncan, that was absolutely terrible, all of it.
[08:35.15]It's okay. I know what you're gonna say.
[08:37.05]Congratulations, wammy.
[08:38.95]But I was awful.
[08:40.55]Yeah, but you're the only one who tried out.
[08:42.75]See you at the big game.
[08:46.05]I can't believe this.
[08:47.75]Well, in hindsight,
[08:50.35]I guess we should have noticed
[08:52.35]that nobody else was here.
[08:57.65]Hey, Gabe, do me a favor.
[09:00.15]Check the back of my head.
[09:02.05]Does it look like I'm going bald?
[09:04.05]Well, it's tempting to say yes,
[09:06.55]So yes.
[09:09.05]Seriously?
[09:10.35]No.
[09:11.85]Your hair is as full and stupid-looking as ever.
[09:14.95]Thank you.
[09:17.15]You're a good brother.
[09:19.55]Is this why you wanted me to come down here?
[09:21.85]No, it is time to train Charlie for the baby race.
[09:25.65]Charlie Charlie?
[09:27.35]I thought the baby race was gonna be
[09:29.65]You and Emmett in diapers.
[09:31.65]Now I've lost interest.
[09:34.25]Okay, turbo baby,
[09:36.45]Let's see what you've got.
[09:46.85]Looks like I've got a little work to do.
[10:38.65]There she is.
[10:41.75]Hi, mom.
[10:43.45]Hi, Wammy.
[10:47.95]Oh, did Miss Covington call you?
[10:50.15]No, it's on the school website.
[10:52.25]Already? There's not a picture up of me, is there?
[10:55.15]There is now.
[10:57.15]I just sent one in.
[10:59.95]And I've got a big surprise for you.
[11:04.65]I kept it at the end of my last `season`. 季节赛季
[11:06.55]It's been sitting in the back of the shed for the last 20 years.
[11:09.95]Then I can't wait to put it on my head.
[11:12.75]Come on.
[11:14.45]Get it on there, girl. We've got some work to do.
[11:18.15]Teddy, you look so beautiful.
[11:21.65]Smells like armpit in here.
[11:24.55]I know. You'll get used to it.
[11:26.85]Okay, I'm gonna teach you some of my signature Wammy moves.
[11:34.95]You gotta hit it hard, girl.
[11:39.95]Now you gotta keep in rhythm.
[11:42.25]And the best way to do that is with the Wammy wiggle.
[11:45.25]A-five, six, seven, eight!
[11:53.15]Now we're gonna build on that move. You ready?
[11:56.15]We're gonna get our steam up. It goes like this.
[11:58.85]Whoo, ah-whoo, ah-whoo.
[12:01.35]No no, sweetheart. You lost your wiggle.
[12:04.35]If you try to get your steam up without the wiggle,
[12:06.35]You'll just look like a fool out there.
[12:08.35]Sure wouldn't want that to happen.
[12:12.25]Next I want you to jump up in the air
[12:14.55]And you gotta land with your arms forming a big " W" .
[12:20.05]That's really cute.
[12:22.05]No no no, Teddy. It's all in the elbows.
[12:24.05]You're not Vammy. You're not Hammy.
[12:26.25]You're Wammy!
[12:28.95]Okay, girl, you do it.
[12:30.95]Now dig deep and let your fire fly!
[12:33.55]I can't do this.
[12:35.45]Sure you can. You just gotta practice.
[12:37.15]Wammy wasn't built in a day.
[12:38.35]No, I don't want to do this.
[12:40.75]What?
[12:42.05]I don't want to be Hammy or Vammy or Wammy!
[12:45.85]I quit.
[13:06.05]Hey, what did you do to your mother?
[13:09.15]I told her I didn' want to be a Wammy.
[13:11.05]I was just being honest with her.
[13:12.55]Honest? What are you thinking?
[13:15.85]How's she taking it?
[13:17.85]Not well.
[13:19.25]She's lying in bed with her Wammy head on,
[13:21.25]Stuffing tissues up her `snout`.  鼻子；猪嘴；烟草；鼻口部



[13:23.25]I don't know.
[13:24.85]Maybe being Wammy was cool when you guys were in school. . .
[13:27.25]Are you kidding me? It was never cool.
[13:29.55]Your mom just didn't know that.
[13:31.95]How could she not know that?
[13:33.95]Did she spend all four years of high school wearing that giant head?
[13:36.65]It was her yearbook picture.
[13:42.05]Look, Teddy, if you don't go to that big game
[13:45.05]There's gonna be no Wammy,
[13:46.95]And that is gonna break your mother's heart.
[13:49.75]Dad, I just don't want to look stupid.
[13:51.95]Look, you're gonna let your mom and everybody at school down
[13:55.25]Because you're afraid of looking stupid?
[13:57.35]Yes, thank you for understanding.
[14:00.15]Honey, I'm not gonna tell you what to do.
[14:04.45]But just remember,
[14:06.35]Sometimes the right decision
[14:08.35]Can feel like the wrong decision.
[14:10.75]And the hard decision can be the best decision.
[14:13.75]But the good decision. . .
[14:15.55]Oh, come on, please just be Wammy!
[14:29.25]Hey, Wammy. Going somewhere?
[14:33.35]Ever been to north high? 'cause I was thinking
[14:35.55]We could all take a little trip.
[14:38.95]It's about to charge. Get it!
[14:43.45]Oh, this is the greatest prank ever!
[14:55.05]All right, let's see what `nerd` is wearing the costume this year. 讨厌的人
[15:02.75]Dude, Wammy's old.
[15:06.15]Wammy is not old. Wammy had four kids.
[15:18.35]I didn't see her. Your mom's not in there.
[15:20.75]I can't believe it.
[15:22.65]She's the only reason I'm doing this stupid thing.
[15:24.95]Well, let's get out of here.
[15:26.85]Duncan, the gym's this way.
[15:30.35]Let me look at you.
[15:33.35]Not you. . . Wammy. Put on the head.
[15:38.75]Oh, you look so much like your mother.
[15:43.25]Showtime!
[15:45.45]I'm right behind you, t. Got your back.
[16:03.35]Gentlemen, start your babies.
[16:08.85]Go!
[16:15.75]And they're off!
[16:16.95]Oh, look, Mason. Yummy yummy.
[16:19.25]Come to the peaches.
[16:22.15]Come to mommy. Come to mommy.
[16:26.15]Mason got the early lead. Charlie's bringing up the rear.
[16:31.05]Look at my boy go. He's barely breaking a sweat.
[16:34.25]At the halfway mark it's Mason, followed by Charlie.
[16:36.55]Come on, Charlie. You can do it.
[16:39.75]Coming down the home stretch. It's still Mason in the lead.
[16:42.55]Come on, Charlie. It's now or never.
[16:50.85]And the winner is. . .
[16:53.25]Charlie!
[17:04.65]Oh my gosh! Charlie, you just took your first steps.
[17:08.15]Mason Not your best day, Mason.
[17:10.25]What went wrong out there?
[17:13.25]We'll be back when we learn how to walk.
[17:24.35]Can you please take me back to the gym?
[17:27.15]No way. Not till the game's over.
[17:29.85]Okay, can you take me home then?
[17:33.45]I don't even care about the game, guys.
[17:35.45]North High, South High. . . what's the difference?
[17:37.85]Only one thing. . .
[17:40.05]- North High rules! - Yeah!
[17:42.75]Yeah, baby!
[17:44.75]Okay, whatever.
[17:46.45]Look, if we're gonna drive around in circles for hours,
[17:48.95]- Can I at least use the bathroom? - Can't you hold it?
[17:51.45]I've had four kids. I pee when I sneeze.
[17:54.25]Gross.
[17:56.65]Pull over.
[17:59.15]Thank you. You're such a gentleman.
[18:13.85]South High rules!
[18:22.65]Safety first.
[18:25.95]Ram on the lam!
[18:34.75]Staring at my baldness
[18:36.55]Ain't gonna stop your baldness.
[18:38.15]I just can't believe that's gonna happen to me.
[18:41.25]Would you stop focusing on the negatives?
[18:43.25]- Think about the positives. - Like what?
[18:46.15]You're gonna have a large baseball cap collection.
[18:49.85]You're gonna save on shampoo.
[18:52.55]And with the money you save on shampoo
[18:54.45]You can buy more baseball caps.
[18:58.45]Here comes Teddy.
[20:35.25]That's my best friend.
[20:37.45]Wammy's my best friend.
[20:44.05]Wammy! Wammy! Wammy!
[20:55.45]Well, Charlie, looks like we both took baby steps today.
[20:58.95]You walked for the first time
[21:00.85]And I did something I didn't want to do and wound up liking it.
[21:04.05]And I hope you like it too, because. . .
[21:07.65]You are aready on your way.
[21:10.95]Wammy jammy!
[21:14.25]Charlie Good luck, Charlie.
[21:18.65]Come on, P. J. We're gonna be late for school.
[21:20.75]Get down here.
[21:24.45]Alright, coming. Chillax.
[21:31.55]Oh, oh, no.
[21:32.75]Oh, no. It's happening.
[21:35.75]No, I am not ready.
[21:39.15]No.
[21:46.25]- Bad Dream? - Yeah.
[21:48.55]Oh, hey. Here's the first one my dad gave me.

## 1.5
[00:08.15]Hey, Charlie, Teddy here
[00:10.35]On the couch where I almost got my first kiss with Spencer.
[00:14.45]But she didn't.
[00:17.55]No no, because
[00:20.65]I made the mistake of bringing the cute boy home
[00:23.35]Where my dear family lives.
[00:25.95]He wasn't that cute.
[00:30.35]Get out.
[00:34.25]Anyway, still waiting on that first kiss.
[00:37.25]But there's a dance this Friday
[00:39.55]Where the girls ask the guys,
[00:41.25]And this time I'm going to make sure I get it.
[00:43.45]Get what, honey?
[00:47.45]Oh, my first A+ in science, daddy.
[00:52.25]That's my girl.
[00:56.35]Hey, dad, great news. I got a job.
[00:59.05]Stop right there. I'm having the greatest dream of my life.
[01:02.95]The school's gonna pay me 100 bucks to DJ at the dance on Friday.
[01:06.85]The dream continues.
[01:09.15]I just need you to give me $200 to rent the DJ equipment.
[01:12.85]And now I'm awake.
[01:15.15]Hey, what was I doing in the dream?
[01:18.85]You weren't saying anything, which is why I thought it was a dream.
[01:23.85]P. J. , why would you take a job where you're gonna lose money?
[01:27.55]Does everything always have to be about money?
[01:32.05]Are you giving me the 200?
[01:34.15]Sorry, son. You're gonna have to come up with the money some other way.
[01:38.25]Like how?
[01:40.65]Oh, I know. Get a job.
[01:46.85]I'll be right back.
[01:48.55]Wait, where's your sister?
[01:49.85]Emmett Don't bother her, Emmett.
[01:51.15]Okay, where shouldn't I bother her?
[01:52.55]In the kitchen.
[01:53.35]All right. Thanks
[01:56.85]Hey, Teddy bear.
[01:58.75]Hey, Emmett.
[02:00.85]You know this dance this Friday night is" girls ask guys, " right?
[02:04.25]Uh-huh.
[02:06.15]You're a girl. I'm a guy.
[02:10.95]Something you want to ask me?
[02:13.05]Okay, Emmett, listen,
[02:16.15]P. J. is my brother and you're his best friend.
[02:19.05]So in a way you're kind of like my brother too.
[02:21.85]And I can't go to the dance with my brother.
[02:24.55]You can see why that would be wrong, right?
[02:27.75]This is the longest conversation we've ever had.
[02:31.75]Did you hear anything I just said?
[02:35.05]Something about wanting to go to the dance with a brother.
[02:39.05]Emmett, I want you to listen to me very carefully.
[02:43.05]I'm not going to ask you to the dance.
[02:45.95]When you touch me it feels like electricity.
[03:10.85]Santa Colonel C WaitinZ
[02:52.45]Today's all burnt toast
[02:54.05]running late, and dad jokes
[02:55.65]Has anybody seen my left shoe
[02:58.15]I close my eyes, take a bite
[03:00.45]Grab a ride, laugh out loud
[03:02.25]There it is up on the roof
[03:04.85]I've been there, I've survived
[03:08.15]So just take my advice
[03:11.55]Hang in there, baby,
[03:13.75]Things are crazy
[03:15.35]But I know your future is bright
[03:18.35]Hang in there, Baby
[03:20.25]There is no maybe
[03:21.85]Eveything turns out all right
[03:24.75]Sure life is up and down
[03:27.15]But trust me, it comes back all around
[03:30.25]You're gonna love who you turn out to be
[03:35.75]Hang in there, Baby
[03:38.55]Good Luck Charlie S01E05 Dance Off
[03:44.55]Hi, kids.
[03:46.35]Hey, mom.
[03:47.15]Come on, Charlie, let's go see daddy.
[03:48.75]You know what I realized today?
[03:50.55]Charlie's never played laser tag.
[03:52.15]I bet she'd enjoy doing that on Friday night.
[03:54.35]Oh, how very sweet and unselfish of you.
[03:57.45]But Charlie's gonna be with us Friday night.
[03:59.25]It's your school's open house.
[04:00.65]Right. Forgot about that.
[04:03.15]Well, we haven't.
[04:04.95]Dad and I can't wait to meet this miracle worker--Mrs. Mellish.
[04:07.95]She's the first teacher who hasn't called to complain about you.
[04:10.45]Are you sure he's actually going to school?
[04:13.75]Mom, you've been to so many `open houses`.
在教育领域，"open house" 也可以指学校或其他机构为家长和学生举办的开放日或庆祝活动，让家长有机会了解学校、教育计划以及与教育工作者交流。

[04:16.45]And you'd love laser tag.
[04:18.25]It's like a workout but you get to shoot stuff.
[04:20.65]Oh, come on, we can play laser tag anytime.
[04:22.95]Meeting a teacher that has no problems with you--
[04:25.25]That may never happen again.
[04:28.95]This is bad.
[04:31.45]What's bad?
[04:32.45]The only reason I haven't been getting in trouble
[04:34.45]Is that I told my teacher mom and dad have been fighting a lot.
[04:36.95]That actually works?
[04:38.45]You also have to give the teacher one of these.
[04:43.15]Wow, that's good.
[04:45.65]I almost hugged you. And I never want to hug you.
[04:48.95]Works even better on Mrs. Mellish.
[04:50.95]Any time I do something wrong--
[04:52.95]Mommy and daddy were fighting again.
[04:57.35]Wow.
[04:59.05]Well, I guess your evil plan is gonna be over on Friday night,
[05:02.45]'cause mom and dad won't be fighting.
[05:06.55]Or will they?
[05:14.05]So who are you asking to the dance?
[05:17.55]Okay, here's a hint. He's really cute and--
[05:20.25]You ladies talking about me again?
[05:22.35]You know I'm not talking about you,
[05:24.95]Since I dumped your sorry butt a long time ago.
[05:27.95]That's now how me and my sorry butt remember it.
[05:34.45]Remind me again why you ever went out with him.
[05:36.95]Only one way to explain it--
[05:39.05]Brain fart.
[05:40.65]Brain fart.
[05:42.55]So who's this cutie you're gonna ask?
[05:45.65]Spencer Spencer.
[05:48.15]Oh, right,
[05:50.05]Mr. Almost first kiss.
[05:52.85]You'd better get moving on that. Your window is closing.
[05:56.15]What window?
[05:57.25]The window of opportunity.
[05:58.95]Oh, thanks. That really clears things up.
[06:01.05]T, you almost kissed this guy,
[06:04.25]But nothing happened since then.
[06:05.65]If you don't act soon, you're doomed to be just friends.
[06:09.25]I like Spencer, he likes me,
[06:11.05]And I'll ask him when the time is right.
[06:12.85]That better be right now, chica,
[06:14.65]Because Lauren Sandoval is gonna ask him.
[06:16.35]Lauren would never do that to me. She's too good a friend.
[06:19.35]There's your good friend right now.
[06:21.35]Here? Walking up to Spencer
[06:22.95]What? That little witch!
[06:30.05]Yeah!
[06:33.15]Oh, Lauren, you poor thing.
[06:36.95]What a horrible, ugly tomatoey mess you are.
[06:41.65]Come on, pizza face, let's get you cleaned up.
[06:44.95]Come on.
[06:49.85]Oh, Spencer, hey. Didn't see you there.
[06:52.95]Hi, Teddy.
[06:54.25]Boy, that pizza really came out of nowhere, huh?
[06:57.15]Yeah. Nice shot.
[06:59.25]It's all in the wrist.
[07:06.55]Now tell me again
[07:08.55]And don't leave out a single detail--
[07:10.65]What exactly did Spencer say when you asked him?
[07:12.75]He said, and I quote,
[07:14.95]" Okay."
[07:21.25]Oh, wouldn't it be so romantic
[07:23.25]If I got my first kiss during a slow dance?
[07:25.75]That could happen if you don't wear that red polka dot thing
[07:28.95]That makes you look like a clown.
[07:30.95]No no, you're right.
[07:33.65]I should dress more subtle and understated
[07:35.95]Like you.
[07:38.55]That's all I'm saying.
[07:40.85]Now I just have to figure out
[07:43.75]How Spencer and I are gonna get to the dance.
[07:45.85]How are you getting there?
[07:47.15]I haven't asked anyone yet.
[07:49.05]I'm still trying to decide between five guys.
[07:52.95]Well, do any of them drive?
[07:55.35]Let's see. . .
[07:57.25]Sophomore, freshman, sophomore,
[07:59.55]Eighth-grader I don't really want to talk about,
[08:04.05]And sophomore.
[08:05.55]So no, no drivers on the list.
[08:07.45]That's too bad, because if you could find somebody who drives
[08:10.35]Then Spencer and I could double with you.
[08:12.05]Yeah, consider it done. I'll just expand my list
[08:15.25]And lower my standards a little bit.
[08:17.55]Lower than the eighth grade?
[08:20.05]You want a ride or not?
[08:24.15]Okay, they say it's gonna be chilly tonight.
[08:27.75]I want to make sure you're nice and toasty.
[08:32.05]Did I remember to change your diaper?
[08:35.55]I'm gonna go with yes.
[08:39.15]Are you ready to go?
[08:40.75]Yeah
[08:41.45]It is gonna be so nice to go to an open house
[08:43.75]And not to have to hear the words
[08:45.65]" Oh, you're Gabe's parents."
[08:50.05]Mom, are you wearing perfume?
[08:53.15]I am.
[08:54.55]Oh.
[08:55.85]What? You don't like it?
[08:57.35]Oh, I like it, but. . .
[09:00.45]But what? Does someone else not like it?
[09:02.75]I don't want to get dad in trouble.
[09:07.45]Wait, dad says he doesn't like my perfume?
[09:09.35]He doesn't just say it. He makes a face too.
[09:12.15]And sometimes there's gagging.
[09:16.85]Oh.
[09:18.75]Well, that's interesting.
[09:20.65]Has your father shared anything else with you
[09:24.15]About how I disgust him?
[09:29.75]I've said too much already.
[09:31.75]Oh, okay.
[09:34.25]Okay.
[09:37.05]Nice jacket, dad.
[09:39.45]Isn't it? Got my company logo right there--
[09:42.55]Free advertising and a great conversation starter.
[09:47.55]Does mom know you're wearing it?
[09:50.25]Oh, I've been dressing myself for some time now.
[09:54.65]So no, I didn't run it by her.
[09:56.95]Oh, I guess she'll just have to live with it.
[10:02.55]Why? Is there a problem?
[10:05.55]I don't want to get mom in trouble,
[10:10.25]But just between us,
[10:12.05]She thinks you talk too much about your job.
[10:16.95]I talk too much about my job--
[10:18.85]The same job that puts a roof over your mother's head?
[10:21.65]Hey, I'm on your side.
[10:23.25]So what else does she say about me behind my back?
[10:28.95]I've said too much already.
[10:31.65]Come on, guys. Gotta go. Gonna be late.
[10:34.25]Well, we're taking the bug truck,
[10:36.35]If that's okay with you.
[10:37.75]As long as the windows work.
[10:40.15]I don't want to trigger anyone's gag reflex.
[10:46.65]Women.
[10:51.15]Hey, good luck at your open house tonight.
[10:53.25]Good luck at whatever you're dressed so weird for.
[11:03.95]Look at you.
[11:05.75]Oh, no, look at you.
[11:07.65]Well, I wish I was someone else
[11:09.55]So I could look at both of us.
[11:13.65]So where's your date?
[11:15.35]Parking the car.
[11:17.35]Oh, I like it. Who is he?
[11:19.55]Okay, about that-- there's something you should know--
[11:22.45]'sup?
[11:33.55]Emmett, would you excuse us for a minute real quick?
[11:36.15]Okay, just--
[11:39.95]Emmett?
[11:41.95]We needed transportation.
[11:43.85]It was either emmett or an eighth-grader
[11:46.95]With a skateboard.
[11:50.05]Let's just go have a good time, okay?
[12:01.75]Shall we?
[12:04.75]Teddy bear.
[12:09.95]Grizzly bear.
[12:19.05]You look really nice.
[12:21.05]You are really nice.
[12:23.35]Thanks.
[12:27.25]Whose car is this?
[12:29.05]My grandpa's. He thinks I'm at the store getting bread.
[12:32.55]But instead
[12:34.75]You'll be at the dance getting nothing.
[12:38.75]Wow, looks like my seat belt's broken.
[12:42.45]Maybe I should sit in the middle.
[12:44.35]Is that okay?
[12:45.95]Yeah.
[12:47.05]'cause I'm all about safety.
[12:51.15]Teddy, you're blocking my view.
[12:53.45]You mind moving away from Spencer?
[12:57.35]Big guy, lean the other way.
[13:02.35]More.
[13:04.75]More.
[13:06.35]Emmett, if he leans any more, he'll fall out of the car.
[13:08.85]More.
[13:20.35]Well, this is my classroom.
[13:22.45]Mrs. Mellish looks busy.
[13:23.75]Maybe we should come back next year.
[13:25.85]Whoa, p-u alert.
[13:29.15]I get it, okay?
[13:32.35]I'm talking about Charlie's diaper. What's her problem?
[13:35.55]Heck if I know.
[13:37.35]And for your information,
[13:39.15]Some people find that scent very pleasant.
[13:43.35]A full diaper?
[13:46.25]I'm gonna be back in a minute.
[13:48.15]I'm gonna go change Charlie, okay?
[13:50.05]Okay
[13:51.05]Hi, Gabe.
[13:52.95]Hi, Mrs. Mellish.
[13:54.55]How is my brave little soldier?
[13:56.05]Not good. mom and dad are fighting again.
[13:59.85]Oh, you poor thing.
[14:01.25]They've been fighting all week.
[14:03.25]I don't think I can get that book report into time you on Tuesday.
[14:08.05]That's okay, dear.
[14:10.55]You take all the time you need.
[14:12.75]I don't need time.
[14:14.75]I need happiness.
[14:17.15]Oh.
[14:39.05]All right. That song was brought to you by Freddy's stereo hut.
[14:43.55]When you're ready to rock steady, go see Freddy.
[14:46.55]P. J. , what's with all the commercials?
[14:49.55]That's how I'm paying for all the equipment.
[14:51.15]I got some sponsors to buy advertising.
[14:52.65]Who would buy advertising from you?
[14:54.65]You'd be surprised.
[14:56.65]This next one is brought to you by mom
[14:59.25]Who gave me 20 bucks.
[15:01.15]Mom-- when you absolutely, positively
[15:03.25]Can't get any more money out of dad.
[15:10.95]Bob, come here, honey, look.
[15:15.25]Look at this picture Gabe drew.
[15:16.95]Isn't that sweet?
[15:18.35]Yeah, it sure is. You know what, honey?
[15:22.05]I guess we're doing something right.
[15:24.05]Would you look at that?
[15:26.15]Gabe, it seems like your parents are getting along.
[15:28.85]I'm gonna go introduce myself.
[15:30.65]Gotta think. gotta think.
[15:39.55]Ricky It's go time, Ricky.
[15:43.45]Excuse me, lady. You've got a rat on your shoulder.
[15:47.75]Rat on the loose!
[15:49.65]Remain calm. Remain calm.
[15:52.15]Remain calm. Remain calm.
[15:57.25]Spencer, could you get me some punch, please?
[16:00.15]Sure. I'll be right back.
[16:02.85]Emmett, why don't you go get me some punch too?
[16:05.65]What, your feet don't work?
[16:08.65]Ice or no ice?
[16:09.95]Surprise me.
[16:12.05]I think it's time for me to make my move.
[16:14.15]Go get that kiss, girl.
[16:17.05]Hey, P. J. , put on a slow song, okay?
[16:19.45]You got it, sis.
[16:20.95]Okay, we're gonna bring it down now,
[16:24.55]Just like you should bring yourselves down to Wally's Waffles.
[16:28.65]Tell them P. J. sent you. You can get a free pat of butter.
[16:35.25]Here you go.
[16:36.75]Oh, thanks.
[16:38.45]Let's dance.
[16:49.85]Yo, quick, throw on some hip-hop.
[16:51.95]But I just started this song.
[16:53.65]Now.
[16:56.05]Okay, this next one is brought to you by Emmett.
[16:59.45]Emmett-- he's. . .
[17:01.35]Standing right there.
[18:46.05]What just happened?
[18:48.45]Emmett stole my date.
[18:52.85]Back we go, little guy,
[18:55.65]Safe and sound.
[18:58.65]Boy, really tired. We should go.
[19:01.75]Thank you, Mr. Duncan. That was very impressive.
[19:05.65]Well, when you've been in the pest control biz
[19:07.95]As long as I have, you--
[19:09.85]You know, I really shouldn't talk about my work.
[19:13.85]It bugs my wife.
[19:15.85]No, it doesn't. Why would you think that?
[19:18.25]Because Gabe told me it did.
[19:19.85]Charlie looks more tired than me, so. . .
[19:23.95]Gabe told me you hated my perfume.
[19:25.75]I never said that. What are you talking about?
[19:27.55]Oh, please don't do this here.
[19:29.45]Isn't it bad enough that poor Gabe has to listen
[19:31.65]To you two constantly fighting at home?
[19:33.95]We don't fight at home. We're very happy.
[19:37.35]Look at this picture Gabe drew of our family.
[19:39.45]That's not his.
[19:41.25]That's Gabe M's.
[19:42.85]This is Gabe D's.
[19:48.55]That's disturbing.
[19:50.95]Mrs. mellish, I assure you we're a very loving family.
[19:55.25]Gabe, get your butt over here.
[19:59.15]Now why would you tell your teacher that we're fighting at home.
[20:02.05]So I could get out of doing my work.
[20:06.05]I'm in big trouble, right?
[20:07.75]Oh, yeah.
[20:09.55]Have all your overdue assignments on my desk Monday morning.
[20:13.85]But that'll take me the whole weekend.
[20:16.15]You poor thing.
[20:20.65]Get your coat. We're leaving.
[20:24.25]I can't believe we let him play us like that.
[20:26.65]I know. How could I ever think you didn't like my perfume?
[20:29.55]Well, it's not my favorite.
[20:32.15]Said the guy with the cartoon cockroach on his blazer.
[20:40.35]It's an ant.
[20:42.65]Man, your jerking is dope.
[20:45.25]Man, your popping-- sick.
[20:47.65]I'd like to pop both of these jerks.
[20:51.85]Sorry you didn't get that kiss.
[20:53.95]Yeah, well, the night's not over yet.
[20:56.75]Follow my lead.
[20:58.75]Hey, what's that noise?
[21:01.45]What noise?
[21:02.65]The noise teddy is talking about.
[21:05.25]Sounds like it's coming from the back of the car.
[21:07.55]Yeah, I hear it too. It sounds bad.
[21:10.65]You should probably pull over and check it out.
[21:13.35]- I'm telling you-- - Stop the car!
[21:17.85]Just come on, I'll show you where the noise is coming from.
[21:20.85]I know where the noise is coming from.
[21:23.35]You want to keep that head?
[21:25.25]I suggest you not do that again.
[21:39.05]Oh, sorry, sorry.
[21:43.35]In my head that went a lot smoother.
[21:49.45]Hello there.
[21:51.35]Hi.
[21:52.95]Look, I'm sorry I got so caught up with Emmett and the dancing.
[21:57.25]I kind of like the way things were going before then.
[21:59.75]Yeah, me too.
[22:01.55]I'm glad we got to go to the dance together.
[22:03.55]I was a little nervous because
[22:05.05]Ivy said my window closing.
[22:06.55]And then Lauren Sandoval almost asked you.
[22:08.95]and then Ivy and Emmett showed up at my house
[22:10.65]And I was like, " oh, no. how is it gonna working."
[22:11.95]And I just--
[22:17.05]That was a really nice way of telling me to shut up.
[22:29.05]Well, Charlie, I finally got my first kiss tonight
[22:32.25]And now I can't stop smiling.
[22:34.25]I mean who knew that Emmett's grandpa's car
[22:36.15]Would turn out to be the most romantic place in the world?
[22:40.35]Okay, I'm gonna try and stop smiling.
[22:48.35]No, I can't do it.
[22:59.65]Man, look at that girl working.
[23:02.05]Wow. I thought we were good.
[23:04.15]Not as good as that.
[23:06.15]She's got it going on.

## 1.17

I've been pranking you.

## 1.22

[00:08.85]Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
[00:11.45]Listen to spencer's latest status update.
[00:13.25]" just chilling at home." who cares?
[00:17.75]Apparently you do.
[00:21.05]Mom. No no, I do not.
[00:23.55]I could care less what my ex-boyfriend is up to.
[00:25.45]Oh, he hasn't even changed his online status yet.
[00:28.45]It still says " in a relationship."
[00:30.75]- He just can't let me go. - Well, maybe he forgot to change it.
[00:33.65]Uh, mom, how could he forget? He's online all the time.
[00:36.75]And you know this how?
[00:38.15]I check his status every hour.
[00:40.85]Well, the important thing is you've moved on.
[00:46.65]Gabe honey, you have a playdate this afternoon.
[00:49.45]- No, I don't. - Yes, you do.
[00:51.45]A new family moved in down the street.
[00:52.95]And they have a son your age,
[00:54.55]So I made plans for the two of you to get together.
[00:56.35]Oh, mom, let me explain where you went wrong.
[01:00.15]I'm 11. I don't have " playdates" anymore.
[01:04.45]I hang.
[01:07.45]His name is austin and I think he'll be.
[01:09.75]A very good influence on you. He's very well-behaved.
[01:12.25]You know that well-behaved and I are natural enemies.
[01:16.35]Could you just be nice?
[01:18.65]Okay, be civil.
[01:21.95]It's too late to cancel.
[02:31.95]Please don't be a `plumbing problem`. 管道问题
[02:39.05]Thank you. We'll be in touch.
[02:42.95]What is. . . what is going on?
[02:45.35]We're having auditions for a new band member.
[02:47.65]P. J. And the vibe need a fuller sound
[02:49.85]so we can start getting gigs.
[02:50.85]And that fuller sound is gonna come from a `didgeridoo`? 迪吉里杜管(澳洲土著人的乐器)
[02:56.05]All right, look. How much longer are these `audition`s gonna go on? 试演，试唱
[02:59.05]- For a few more hours. - Oh man.
[03:02.25]I really gotta get my own place.
[03:14.75]Next.
[03:31.25]Thanks. Uh, you can keep the microphone.
[03:44.25]Wait. Stop.
[03:46.65]- That was awful. - Emmett, don't be rude.
[03:49.75]I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna `sugarcoat` it,
"**Sugarcoat**" 是一个常用作动词的词汇，意指让某事物看起来比实际情况更积极或轻微。当有人对信息进行“sugarcoat”时，他们以更让人接受或愉悦的方式呈现信息，通常是为了避免引起不适或冒犯。
[03:51.65]Even if she is my grandma.
[04:06.25]- What do you think? - Well, he's pretty good,
[04:08.35]But I'm not sure if he has the right look.
[04:10.15]What do you mean?
[04:11.75]Well, you and me are so hot.
[04:14.05]And he's so. . .
[04:18.35]Not.
[04:20.65]I can't argue with that.
[04:22.65]Listen, jimmy.
[04:25.15]We're gonna think about it and let you know.
[04:27.15]Could you let me know soon?
[04:27.95]'cause my brother's having a party this weekend.
[04:29.75]And he wants live music. He's willing to pay.
[04:33.35]Welcome to the band.
[04:42.55]Hey, austin. Come on in.
[04:44.75]Gabe honey, austin's here.
[04:46.75]What a lovely home, mrs. Duncan.
[04:48.55]So comfortable looking.
[04:50.15]What a nice way of saying messy.
[04:53.95]Gabe, this is austin.
[04:55.55]- How do you do? - How do I do what?
[05:00.95]- He's saying hello. - Why are you dressed like that?
[05:04.25]Well, I wasn't sure what activities you had planned,
[05:06.95]So I settled on daytime casual. 我穿了日常休闲装
[05:10.45]Really, mom?
[05:12.05]This is how you want me to spend my afternoon?
[05:14.55]Well, you boys have fun. I'll be upstairs with charlie.
[05:17.75]Poor little bby's not feeling well.
[05:19.65]Poor little gaby's not feeling so hot either.
[05:23.05]What do you want to do, play video games?
[05:25.35]- Oh, I'm not allowed. - Watch tv?
[05:27.65]I've already exceeded my `allot`ted one hour of the week.  指定的分配的
[05:30.15]- Go to the park? - I'm not wearing `sunscreen`. 遮光剂, 防晒霜
[05:33.15]How do you think this is going?
[05:38.15]Hey, guys.
[05:39.75]Hi.
[05:41.95]I don't believe we've met.
[05:43.25]Teddy, austin; Austin, teddy.
[05:46.15]- Nice to meet you, austin. - The pleasure is all mine.
[05:49.75]Well, aren't you a little gentleman?
[05:55.35]She's glorious.
[05:57.15]What an exquisite creature.
[06:01.25]Look, we have to figure out how to get through this.
[06:04.25]So either you stop being weird or. . .
[06:08.75]Yeah, that's the only way.
[06:16.95]that's why monkeys shouldn't fly
[06:23.15]- Planes! - Yeah.
[06:25.05]- Yes! - Yeah!
[06:26.85]Yeah! That was awe-teous!
[06:32.05]- " awe-teous" ? - Yeah.
[06:34.25]I took " awesome" and `mash`ed it with " `righteous`."

mash: **A mixture made by crushing or mixing different ingredients:**
Example: "A mash of fruits and berries."

`righteous`:
"**Righteous**"（义字解释）是一个形容词，通常用来描述某人或某事在道德或伦理标准下是正确、合理或具有道德高尚的。一个正直的人通常被认为是按照道德和伦理标准行事的人。

[06:36.75]" awe-teous."
[06:38.25]Dude, I love that.
[06:41.35]- Hey, can I get something to drink? - Yeah, the kitchen's upstairs.
[06:46.05]- What do you think of jimmy? - He's " gna-teous."
[06:49.75]- What? - I mashed " gnarly" and " awe-teous."
[06:54.05]" awe-teous" is already a mash-up.
[06:57.05]Just let him do it.
[06:59.75]Charlie honey, drink your juice.
[07:02.25]- It'll make you feel better. - No no.
[07:05.45]I don't think you should argue with me.
[07:07.85]I know a lot more words.
[07:11.25]May I have some water, please?
[07:13.05]Sure, jimmy, coming right up.
[07:15.15]Well, aren't you a cutie-pie?
[07:17.65]I'd be lying if I said I hadn't heard that before.
[07:21.15]- I. . . I meant the baby. - Right. Huh.
[07:25.45]Oh, jimmy, I wouldn't get too close to charlie. She's. . .
[07:28.25]. . . Sick.
[07:31.95]Whoa.
[07:33.35]She `blast`ed me with `snot`. snot n.鼻涕
[07:38.05]Which was also the name of my last band.
[07:49.25]It's austin. Tell him I'm not here.
[07:58.55]Sorry, austin, gabe's not here.
[08:01.45]He's hiding under that blanket.
[08:04.65]Actually, I came to see you.
[08:10.35]- You did? - Well, this just got interesting.
[08:14.85]I brought you some presents.
[08:17.05]An african `orchid`. I cultivate them myself. 兰花
[08:21.15]I also made you some soap.
[08:22.65]Thank you.
[08:26.05]I was `running low on` orchids and soap.
"Running low on" 是一个英语短语，表示某物的数量正在减少，即快用尽或接近耗尽的状态。这通常用于描述资源、货物或某种物品的减少情况
[08:28.95]Anything else?
[08:30.55]I also wanted to ask you something.
[08:33.15]- Okay. - Will you go with me?
[08:35.55]Go with you where?
[08:37.55]I'm asking you to be my girlfriend.
[08:41.95]Wait. I. . . I'm sorry, what?
[08:43.65]I'm almost 16 and you're 11.
[08:45.95]And a half.
[08:48.65]I believe there's a question on the table.
[08:53.05]Teddy, love knows no age.
[08:55.55]But it does know height.
[08:58.25]Austin, I'm flattered, but I just came out of a relationship.
[09:02.05]" I have loved, let us see if that's all."
[09:04.75]E. E. Cummings.
[09:07.35]" I'm not interested." t. R. Duncan.
[09:11.35]Your words say one thing, but your eyes say another.
[09:16.05]Okay. Focus on my hands.
[09:18.55]They're pushing you out the door.
[09:21.85]This is not over. I shall return!
[09:27.05]You know, he's growing on me.
[09:35.05]- I got your message. What's the bad news? - Jimmy's sick.
[09:38.75]Charlie sneezed on him.
[09:39.85]Now he can't make the gig this weekend.
[09:41.55]- Man, that's " awf-able." - Stop that!
[09:46.25]Dude, we have got to find a new bass player and fast.
[09:48.35]- But where? - I don't know.
[10:01.15]- Dad? - Hey.
[10:03.55]Oh sorry.
[10:05.45]I saw it here. I couldn't resist.
[10:07.45]- How'd you learn to do that? - When I was in high school,
[10:09.85]I had my own band. . . the bob duncan experience.
[10:13.55]You were in a band? How come I never knew that?
[10:17.05]Because whenever I start a story.
[10:18.85]With " when I was in high school, " you `zone out`.
Zone out" 是一个英语短语，指的是一个人在注意力涣散或无法集中时，进入一种心不在焉的状态。当你 "zone out" 时，你可能在思考其他事情，心思飘忽，而没有专注于当前的活动或对话。
[10:23.05]I'm sorry. What?
[10:26.65]Well, mr. D. , you are the answers to our prayers.
[10:29.15]How would you like. . .
[10:31.65]Band meeting.
[10:33.25]Band meeting?
[10:35.25]That's not good.
[10:37.75]That's how I `got thrown out `of the bob duncan experience. 被赶出去
[10:42.25]Emmett, I don't want to be the loser who's in a band with his dad.
[10:45.65]A little quieter, guys.
[10:47.45]I know he's old,
[10:50.65]But what choice do we have?
[10:51.95]Still hearing it.
[10:56.55]I guess you're right.
[10:58.15]Dad. . .
[11:00.25]Do you want to do the `gig` with us? 现场演唱会；
[11:02.45]Yes! The experience continues!
[11:05.55]I'm back!
[11:07.35]For one gig only.
[11:09.55]For one gig only.
[11:26.65]" you are the light of my life. Austin.
[11:29.75]P. S. , not to be used in `non-ventilated` areas." 不通风的
[11:33.35]Yep, that's my special `fella`. a man
[11:38.75]- Hey. - Hey.
[11:43.95]Okay. Spencer, uh,
[11:45.95]This is awkward, but I have to tell you something.
[11:49.55]- Sure, what is it? - Well, I heard your online status.
[11:53.55]Says you're in a relationship. . .
[11:55.35]Somebody told me, I don't remember who. . .
[11:57.05]So you should probably change that.
[12:00.05]- I'm just saying. - Actually, I did change it.
[12:03.45]- And then I changed it back. - Huh. Okay look,
[12:06.35]I know you still have feelings for me.
[12:08.25]I get it. I have that effect on people.
[12:11.35]But really, it's time to move on, okay?
[12:14.65]Teddy, my status isn't about you.
[12:16.65]I. . . oh.
[12:20.05]Her name's nicole. We've had a few dates.
[12:23.15]She doesn't go to our school.
[12:25.05]Well, that's. . . that's good for you.







[12:27.55]I mean it's good for both of us, actually,
[12:30.15]Because I'm also in a relationship.
[12:31.85]- You are? - Yes.
[12:33.75]- Cool. Who is it? - Uh, austin. . .
[12:36.85]Is his name.
[12:38.95]Austin doesn't go to our school.
[12:40.85]He. . .
[12:43.05]Got me this candle. Whatever.
[12:45.25]Ah. That's nice.
[12:47.05]Yeah, he's thoughtful like that.
[12:51.85]Ah. It's nicole.
[12:53.85]- I should probably take this. - Oh sure. Go for it.
[12:56.45]I have to call austin anyway. . .
[12:59.25]Once he's old enough to have a phone.
[13:08.85]Hey, te. . . oh.
