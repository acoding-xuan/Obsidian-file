​	It's 9.1.2023，i make a tremendous decision to restart my English studying journey. With the increasing of my age, i gradually realize that English is an inseparate part of my life.  I have been escaping to study English. I always think it's hard to learn English, and i also think English learning isn't important for students not majoring in English. Reversely, i think it's completely wrong. I used to think English learning needs great talent i don't have. But now I think the hard work and interesting is more important.

Life is a long journey,  and it' s time for me to change myself. 



   It’s 9.1.2023, and I have made a tremendous decision to restart my journey of studying English. With the increasing of my age, I gradually realize that English is an inseparable part of my life. I have been avoiding studying English. I always thought it was hard to learn English, and I also believed that English learning was not important for students who are not majoring in English. However, I now realize that this way of thinking is completely wrong. I used to believe that learning English required a great talent that I did not possess. But now I believe that hard work and interest are more importan



Analysis and guidance:

- Pay attention to tenses: Use “It is” instead of “It’s” when referring to the specific date. Also, maintain consistent verb tenses throughout your writing.
- Correct spelling: “inseparate” should be “inseparable”.
- Use proper capitalization: Begin sentences with capital letters, such as “I” instead of “i”.
- Avoid repetitive phrasing: You mentioned “English learning” twice in the same sentence, making it sound redundant. Use synonyms or rephrase your sentence to avoid repetition.
- Clarify your thoughts: Make sure your ideas are clear and concise. For instance, when discussing the importance of English learning, explain why you now believe it is important instead of simply stating that your previous belief was wrong.
- Use appropriate expressions: Instead of saying “used to think English learning needs great talent I don’t have”, it would be better to say “used to think I needed great talent to learn English, which I believed I lacked”. This conveys your previous belief more effectively.

Remember, practice is key when it comes to improving your English writing skills. Keep writing and seeking feedback to continue your progress!



* 背单词的方法：通过读音去记忆单词，把读音和单词进行匹配。
