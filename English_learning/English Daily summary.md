 Today has been the 10th weekend since the start of this semester. I woke up at 11 p.m, and then I went to the canteen to have my lunch as before, then I went to the library to conduct my studying job. I don't know why I felt so tired today. I guessed that perhaps it is so much food I had that caused me so tired  and sleepy. So I decide not to eat too much in the lunch. 
	In the afternoon, I firstly finished the task of learning to use git to control the github. To be honest, it's very easy.
Secondly, I learned how to use kaggle to participate in the data scientific competition. What we need pay attention to is the format of the required data. And luckily, the data we downloaded from the official kaggle website contains a sample file to help us understand the correct format. Thridly, I finished my daily algorithm exericse, I just finshed the search part and only exercised some easy problems. After having dinner, I quickly came back from canteen and started to finished the competition of digit recognition from kaggle. Though this competition is quitely easy, I still learned o lot from it.
	Those are the main things of the whole day.

Today marks the 10th weekend since the beginning of the semester. I woke up at 11 a.m., went to the canteen for lunch as usual, and then proceeded to the library for my study sessions. Strangely, I felt unusually tired today, possibly due to the excess food I consumed, leaving me fatigued and sleepy. Consequently, I've decided to be more mindful of my lunch portions.

In the afternoon, I successfully tackled the task of learning how to use Git to control GitHub. Honestly, it's a straightforward process. Additionally, I delved into understanding how to use Kaggle to participate in data science competitions. Paying attention to the required data format is crucial. Fortunately, `the data downloaded from the official Kaggle website included a sample file, facilitating our understanding of the correct format.` I then completed my daily algorithm exercises, focusing on the search part and solving some relatively easy problems.

After dinner, I `swiftly` returned from the canteen and resumed working on the Kaggle digit recognition competition. Although considered relatively easy, I `glean`ed valuable insights from the experience.

These are the main events of `my entire day`.
